710,"it s also more slippery than this case ,  which is not really a good thing ."
711,"buy this pan ,  at this price ,  while you can !  ."
712,i have to laugh reading these num_num star reviews .
713,"it takes up no space in a drawer ,  but i whip it out whenever i m cutting up foods ."
714,my first impression taking it out of the box was how small and light it was .
715,"chocolate ,  vanilla and cookies n  creme are all superb tasting ."
716,natural food enthusiasts would just get those baby carrot sticks and some apple slices .
717,i m shocked that amazon continues to allow these to be sold .
718,"i love the zip drives ,  but the predator just doesn t cut it ."
719,just make sure you buy the correct case or you will have to remove it before docking .
720,not really any bad reviews on that one .
721,i suspect the real advantage is that these attachments save space .
722,"i took a chance ,  but this just fit so horrible ."
723,"by the time it s due back ,  you ll be plenty frusterated ."
724,i figured i can save myself a lot of money buying my own .
725,amazon ran a freak one day sale on these knives discounted to $ which i immediately snapped up .
726,bright blue led light is annoying as all get out while driving at night .
727,and it can go right in the dishwasher .
728,this product looks good and stands up to normal wear and tear .
729,i am still on the search for a good pair of tweezers !  .
730,i use to love these bars !  my husband and i ate them every day .
731,the box arrived with the flaps bent and partially open  the one piece of tape barely held it together  .
732,"i was playing with my cat the other day and when se grabbed into it ,  it just broke ."
733,i ve had many choppers and food processors that are a huge pain to line up and close .
734,"unfortunately it is very thin ,  and the curve is a bit too flat making a rocking cut more difficult ."
735,i presume kitchenaid  dumbed down  the description to address a demographic with a num_extend grade mentality .
736,after reading the reviews i opted for this one .
737,just what i expected when i ordered it .
738,there isn t as much wood and the black felt isn t laid out on the bottom either .
739,"it would fit in your pants pocket ,  but probably wouldn t be comfortable ."
740,they re easy to use and easy to clean .
741,its bitter to me and even the undertones of the cinnamon seem a little tart .
742,please; to the manufacturer; go back to the pure original formula .
743,"it is very stable  no walking around the counter  ,  easy to clean and quiet  just a moderate whirring sound  ."
744,"i cleaned all the parts ,  put it back together and voila !  it worked ."
745,i am new to baking nice looking stuff .
746,this rack looked a bit more clever than the usual dish dryer rack .
747,"unfortunately ,  i missed the return date by num_num days so i am stuck with these socks ."
748,ronco quality and customer service are in need of major improvements .
749,"to be honest ,  i didnt expect much from them ."
750,i got my mrbeer kit last christmas and have been using it for a year .
751,"if i d known then what i know now ,  i would have passed on this item ."
752,if i have any problems with them i ll let you know .
753,"the bass came through nicely ,  and it was interesting to hear low bass tones when using the hands free ."
754,it popped off and sometimes the phone didn t work with this case on .
755,"just because they are glass ,  does not mean that they break easily ."
756,batting is done via that new idea in baseball game .
757,"i use it for everything ,  and it has never failed me ."
758,i love the fact the price was cheap .
759,the carrying case is improved on the exterior but slightly downgraded in the interior .
760,i use this thermometer for my turkey fryer .
761,the directions are not clear about how to place it .
762,"trust me ,  the super nes version of super wrestlemania is awful in every sense of the word ."
763,basically you have to ensure that you have a good grip on the large blade while closing it .
764,as far as length that was just about right .
765,no more !  this product allows me to use my favorite oils as a spray .
766,the medium sized one split after one use .
767,that really will blow you away with creativity . this game does have its moments .
768,"that said ,  i needed a great vacuum for my hardwood floors and my car ."
769,"now that i m home while writing this review ,  i m sure the battery should last well pass num_extend or more ."
770,this are very useful protectors and are easy to install .
771,this knife is actually my favorite knife and the one i reach for first .
772,for only $ you can t really go wrong .
773,keeps my phone charged up quick and have not had any problems with it yet !  .
774,left him for num_num minutes and when i came back it was destroyed .
775,i have these in multiple sizes and use them with satisfaction every day !  .
776,loved the coffee but .  .  . first machine stopped working after a couple years .
777,"i played some music with it ,  and the sound is really just darn good ."
778,it cut him very badly under his front legs as a result .
779,"given the cost and quality of this knife ,  you just can t go wrong with it ."
780,it gets in the way every time i fill it with tap water .
781,i m going to send this item back and buy another eight quart pressure cooker by presto .
782,i will never use this stuff again and wouldn t recommend it to anybody .
783,"i thought these gummi bears tasted funny ,  like there was perfume in them ."
784,my boys love legos and i played with them a ton as a kid .
785,so that doesn t leave much shelf time here .
786,"the shooting is just nothing new ,  nothing that hasn t been done better before ."
787,"it smelled much better than the serum ,  but it did absolutely nothing ."
788,"seemed to be adquate protection ,  as i drop my phone regularly ."
789,the bags just need to be cut to the correct length .
790,"well ,  as most reviewers have mentioned ,  this game was released with major bugs ."
791,"i love all the product details ,  but this product clogged my pores and i started getting little blackheads ."
792,japanese style  over the european heavy knife style where the knife weight supposedly helps you cut .
793,the only thing i don t like is after about num_num minutesof running it makes a  ticking  noise .
794,i say skip these if you are looking for weight loss aids like i was .
795,will you pay more ?  sure you will but you will never have to buy a replacement in your lifetime .
796,the audio starts to drop out at approximately num_extend
797,be sure to combine order with other items from same company .
798,it works better than i thought it would .
799,i can talk for over num_num continuous hours on this headset  never tried longer  .
800,what people will do when they are desperate .
801,that normally happens if you don t fill and seal a feeder properly so the vacuum isn t formed .
802,this spatula is the first i ever owned made of silicone .
803,it is well constructed and probably one of the most comfortable bluetooth headsets i have used .
804,"these stylii are light ,  colorful and work perfectly on iphone and ipad ."
805,"also to preserve the pan ,  i recommend hand washing only ."
806,i have owned this can opener for num_num years now and i am still mostly happy with it .
807,maybe it would have fared better packed tightly with no extra room inside .
808,so i figured i ve give the progressive a try . so happy i did .
809,"i believe these have been redesigned ,  because the handles seem very resistant to flexing or bending ."
810,this liner was not only expensive it dried out .
811,this protectors works just fine with my iphone .
812,and replacements are available if you happen to break the glass part .
813,i especially loved the smell which helped me sleep .
814,i was only able to test it with my canon num_extend and not with film .
815,it has a jug that can go in the dishwasher .
816,i use it on a regular basis in the kitchen .
817,point i m trying to make is that i love chocolate .
818,"but besides that fact ,  this pouch fits the bb bold much better than the in box pouch ."
819,"combined with the thin delicate walls of the teapot ,  it makes for perfect tea ."
820,"if you got the skin ,  i would try it out and see ."
821,makes it more tangible and tough to the touch .
822,i was excited to get this cleaning kit and when it did i was disapointed .
823,it is great for traveling and heats water very quickly and easily .
824,keep that in mind if you purchase this .
825,it fit so perfect that i bought another one for my brother .
826,also i got the adjustable pressure regulator which made my life a lot easier .
827,i was looking for a big corelle bowl i could use for eating food and not just soup .
828,then the child doesn t want to play with the bald hipponies .
829,i have had to change the battery every num_num days .
830,so glad i purchased the culligan filters for our kitchen faucet .
831,everything looks really good  even some num_num months later  .
832,i will be purchasing another one for my son .
833,"ok ,  i get that there are bound to be some doa bulbs ."
834,shipped fast and looks as shown in images .
835,when not in use they are covered so no dirt or accidental ding to a sensitive area .
836,would recommend to anyone who was looking for samsung captivate galaxy s phone these work great .
837,"after trying water at a friends house who had one of these ,  i decided to try it at home ."
838,"maybe he d prefer just simple k nex pieces to use freeform ,  but his true love lies with lego ."
839,the material is rough and uncomfortable to wear .
840,i m sad to say that this bike doesn t last too long .
841,i mistakenly gave mine away when i thought i would die from stage num_num ovarian cancer .
842,i bought this cable to connect my num_extend to the car radio .
843,works well and makes a heck of a good cup of coffee .
844,i tossed them and got a heavier glove .
845,however on opening the package i found the bottle almost empty .
846,anyway i m not gonna miss buying expensive sonicare toothbrush replacements thats for sure .
847,as usual all cords only last so long then its time to buy a new one .
848,i absolutely love this bluetooth !  when i m looking for a bluetooth headset there are num_num things i look for .
849,the thing that really is annoying about this game is that you only get num_extend to beat every level .
850,"unfortunately ,  i was very disappointed when i only received one replacement pad instead of two ."
851,most times my iphone num_extend will be completely dead by num_num or num_extend
852,"first ,  i didn t use the recipes in the instruction book ."
853,"these are not so good for data uploading from a phone to a computer ,  but the recharging works well ."
854,i would recommend buying another cooling pad and maybe spending a little extra for a higher quality product .
855,you may use the solid vicks vapor rub in place of the more expensive liquid form .
856,"when this happens ,  it becomes impossible to turn the headset off ."
857,"it fits my phone perfectly ,  not loose at all ."
858,"as for me ,  i will stick to my bali bras ."
859,i put an extended battery on so had to retire the case early .
860,i also thought the flavor itself could have been better .
861,but it takes great pictures with the num_extend camera and it has great num_extend video recording .
862,some would only go into the breech half way  too big around  .
863,my issues were carb craving and sweet craving so bad that i actually gained num_num pounds in a month .
864,on the positive side doom num_num reminds me of the pc game aliens vs .
865,so i m sure that people will point out that this is a place to review the unit .
866,i actually found it a little too loud even when shooting stills .
867,perfecto !  !  !  my husband said they re better than tollhouse cookies which used to be our favorite .
868,these probes get dirty sometimes and need replacing .
869,it cleans up in less than a minute . sometimes just a damp cloth does the job .
870,s s s s s s s s s s s s s .
871,also on occasion it acts strange when i try to do voice commands .
872,"made good coffee and quickly ,  a plus on those sleepy mornings ."
873,"simply worthless ,  it did not even last a week ."
874,"it s a rack ,  how fancy can it be ."
875,i was surprised at so many positive reviews for this product .
876,the charger couldn t give % at most times .
877,i think i ended up with about num_num but don t use them much anymore .
878,"i thought i d give this a try after my all time favorite ,  maybelline purestay foundation ,  was discontinued ."
879,not totally surprising since there s no microphone near the mouth .
880,"update :  having used them much more ,  i still think they re wonderful ."
881,cleans much easier than any we have owned .
882,the irony is that these pyrex bowls have plastic lids .
883,"however ,  i ordered it in late spring and the weather throughout the country was unseasonably warm this year ."
884,not true at least at the store i went to .
885,guess what will be under the tree wrapped just for her ?  .
886,i am going to try to contact the customer service dept but i m sure we re past the warranty period .
887,please look at the photos other people uploaded showing the broken toy .
888,hydroquinone is sometimes combined with alpha hydroxy acids that exfoliate the skin to quicken the lightening process .
889,"buyer beware ,  look elsewhere if you want crushed shell glitter ."
890,"overall ,  didn t find it to be too useful or effective !  !   :   ."
891,the only change that s noticed in the graphics is on the action replay .
892,do not get this lens if you plan to use it for video .
893,only drawback is that the bristles flattened on the most used area within num_num or num_num months .
894,i own the dare and this doesn t fit .
895,the coverlet brand fabric bandages are the best you can buy .
896,"these are just great !  nice weight ,  comfortable in the hand ,  great shape ."
897,i followed the directions and let the filter soak num_num times and i ve been drinking good water ever since .
898,"when first powered up using the accessory outlet adapter ,  the unit ran my num_num watt current draw okay ."
899,"so up i went ,  re pulled the straps ,  sat down and worked ."
900,it appeared to be a much brighter green then what it really was .
901,i have used both stock and aftermarket chargers .
902,perfect fit and the iphone num_num fired right up . can t ask for more !  .
903,"when i received the case ,  i felt a little upset ."
904,"by the way ,  i get an average of num_extend of dry brown rice in the measuring cup ."
905,i halved all the ingredients for this pan and it worked perfectly .
906,i gave away my splenda and haven t touched it since i found out about it .
907,"plus ,  it is just easier to get regular mouth jars at any time of year ."
908,it is also much easier to pour from .
909,there really should be an intermediate quality level between these two num_extend
910,"it is not too bulky ,  and easy to put on the phone ."
911,"better yet ,  just go to sam s and pay less than half !  ."
912,"this looks great on my desk ,  works both with my ipad and my iphone ."
913,"the design is terrible ,  too . the phone is thick and bulky ."
914,don t waste your money unless they start selling a new and improved mix .
915,"if you are have tons to carry ,  and just want a massive shoulder crusher this bag will do ."
916,"not saying evo and iphone screens are bad ,  it s just that this one is num_extend"
917,the knife is rather light as some people liken heft to quality .
918,i suggest you keep the following two things in mind as you decide whether or not to buy .
919,none of the issues i experienced were as a result of the product .
920,"putting it on the phone was easy ,  i haven t removed it yet so i can t attest to that ."
921,perhaps the faceted crystals would be more what i was looking for .
922,this seemed like a great idea .  .  . until the kids sat down and started drawing on it .
923,"minor ,  but this is an example of the casualness of their num_extend"
924,it was easy to apply and much less expensive than purchasing this at the kiosk stands in the mall .
925,and my heels get cracked and dry because i exercise a lot and like to wear sandals .
926,it was a dud . the bottle was less expensive than comparable toilet cleaners and the label boasts % more product .
927,the only caveat i would include is the residue left on the removable grind wheel .
928,i will not be buying this as it contains sucralose  artificial sweetener  .
929,"so i read through the book again ,  and realized that i was not letting it vent first ."
930,"it was easy to use ,  from the start ."
931,a few reviewers stated that you need to buy the deluxe expansion pack for this to even work .
932,when using this i noticed my face would break out alot more .
933,i purchased this vacuum to take care of the second floor of my home .
934,"since i fell in love with lotion by nubian heritage ,  i wanted to try their soap ."
935,"as far as i m concerned that is a big omission . inside the unit ,  don t expect to cook large volumes ."
936,the human skin on its own produces squalene as a natural moisturizer .
937,"the edges were loose ,  not fitting at all ."
938,"these pills are so large ,  that i literally could not swallow them ."
939,it works so easily and you can juice right into the receipe .
940,"we re going to get more ,  forget all that plastic crap ."
941,"when it came time to add accessories ,  i did next to no homework ."
942,is very neet item especiatlly since it is usable with num_extend speed as well as num_extend
943,"after becoming more familiar with the press ,  things go a lot faster ."
944,"so while it wasn t leaking yet ,  i worried that it might in the future ."
945,"no a good purchase ,  not a good helper ,  not even a good antenna ."
946,i love ordering from amazon . and the coffee maker is fast and easy to use .
947,i feel like i wasted a lot of money .
948,"i note that ,  as of this writing ,  num_num of num_num have found my review to be helpful ."
949,i stopped using it because my water lilies went from flourishing to just hanging on .
950,"i use it in my office ,  sometimes when tailgating or outside somewhere ."
951,the problem with it is its just plain cheap .
952,"i don t see any need for these ,  especially since they are deadly to humans and pets ."
953,"this is awesome ,  ,  very handy just to charge and have ."
954,i am going to try some other brands of tape adapters hoping for a difference result .
955,no way !  it s stupid !  !  i ve had it for num_num days and i m already getting bored of it .
956,i cannot recommend this or some other type of external charging highly enough .
957,how can you go wrong with beef jerky ?  you can t except this one wasn t that great .
958,bought for a new stainless sink to avoid scratches in the polished surface .
959,also i think this has much improovement from the num_extend version by far .
960,"this is much ,  much better than the electronic one i had and tons easier to clean ."
961,i couldn t push the buttons for volume or power at all .
962,with drying out my skin am having more of a breakout more often .
963,excellent idea but bushnell really fell down on the job with this one .
964,"i don t like the ingredients ,  but that does not trouble some of the people in our household either ."
965,be careful and if you want a dancer try something a little more sturdy .
966,the cable had a problem so i got it replaced through the website .
967,"now ,  everything is where i can readily grab and work ."
968,"however ,  despite this i still found it extremely convenient and would absolutely recommend it ."
969,"it would stop for the first hour ,  then start leaking water out the bottom left rear of that tank ."
970,i didn t think about that when i purchased them .
971,i couldn t even finish the whole box; i had to throw out most of it .
972,the bowl fits any kitchenaid stand mixer and the paddle attaches easily .
973,it cooks food fast and preserves all the food flavors .
974,the notification bar is the best i ve seen on any android num_extend
975,"i ve stopped using all roc products ,  and now i am using olay products ."
976,i had previously purchased a belkin model single usb port for nearly $ via amazon a while back .
977,it is a nice little store filled with helpful people and unique items .
978,i transplanted some of the good plants into regular soil while i could .
979,the perfume spot better refund me the money because i m very disappointed .
980,my only wish is that maybe someday the manufacturer considers making a larger size one .
981,always nice to keep some of these on hand so that they re there when needed .
982,although paying about $ for a num_num lb .
983,"for a fast ,  easy to use ,  simple machine ,  this is the one you want ."
984,this thing is almost supernatural in that nothing sticks to this .
985,i want to keep my baby healthy and around for years to come .
986,i immediately cut them loose and pulled the strings out of each animal .
987,i could not be more disappointed with the buzz .
988,"the case itself is very good ,  although after use the plastic turns yellowish ."
989,one burnt out the second time charging it .
990,rainbow six num_extend arrow  is just a bigger version of the original .
991,spend more and go with the merkury brand .
992,bought one of these many years ago for my mother .
993,"despite what the product description says ,  the oxo smooth edge can opener is not dishwasher safe ."
994,"i listen to them every day at work and within the first week ,  i broke both sides ."
995,voice is clear on both ends and the volume is more than adequate .
996,"i am really ,  really ,  really happy with this very strong and looks like it will last me for years ."
997,the problem described by  moondrake  is not limited to high altitudes .
998,"the style is great ,  but on size for the function and ease in shredding it is a huge miss ."
999,the blade is sharp out of the box .
1000,just make sure you carefully clean out the cutting channel so cheese or other food doesn t accumulate in there .
1001,other home console companies decided to cash in while the genre was sizzling hot .
1002,this is supposed to be a lightly flavored drink .
1003,be very careful what model you choose this for .
1004,"after one use of this sunscreen ,  my face and neck broke out !  i had clear skin before this ."
1005,"this was not purchased from amazon ,  it came with the mixer ."
1006,i figured it is enough time to test it while under warranty .
1007,i love that it doesn t add any bulk to the phone and still protects my phone .
1008,the ds lite s big selling point are its brighter screens .
1009,the outer rubber dose get stretched out a lot quicker .
1010,i grab these knives now rather than my $ ones i ve purchased before .  .  .  .  . they are the best .  .  . and keep their edge .
1011,"however ,  it makes a great beer and comes with bottles that make for easy storage ."
1012,you have to basically be a few inches away from the mic for others to hear you .
1013,"not sure how much it protects ,  because it is not a thick gel ."
1014,"it is grossly inaccurate ,  off by num_extend degrees ."
1015,i tend to use primes a lot and so maybe i expected to much .
1016,then i tried the cable that came with the phone .
1017,it s almost ironic that this set of warmers has the perfect design .
1018,there s one cut scene that goes on for like num_num minutes .
1019,but i guess you pay for what you use .
1020,"i m currently looking into investing in cookware that will last a life time ,  such as cast iron ."
1021,"i haven t used this one ,  but it seems to have pretty good reviews ."
1022,i love it . i am not sure how this new one will measure up to the older unit .
1023,i read the great reviews before buying and would give it num_num stars if i could .
1024,"the camera is particularly well protected ,  since there are holes only for the lenses and the flash ."
1025,i am not sure if i got all the pieces out .
1026,i used them with the ateco num_num cake heating cores which are pin shaped .
1027,if you like black licorice do not order this .
1028,not sure what i can use these things fornow .
1029,bottom line :  the world kitchens old fashioned beef jerky offers a disappointing product at a good price .
1030,"it s just different ,  that s all  and gives it a very clean outside appearance ,  which i really like  ."
1031,it gets rid of odors fast and does a great job of keeping my air clean .
1032,it mounted quickly and easily on my mark iii pistol .
1033,"works well as a coffee filter ,  but does let sediment through ."
1034,and you have to perform them as they unlock certain key mission areas .
1035,"unfortunately ,  i m not too impressed with it s output this season . graphically ,  the game looks pretty good ."
1036,a little over a year ago i purchased a mophie for my iphone num_extend
1037,she had the stuffing out within num_num minutes .
1038,nice little quick reference that takes up no space and is always easy to locate .
1039,she has this one and has been very pleased with it .
1040,i will continue to use it until it doesn t want to work no more .
1041,when i had it installed the first few days it was fine .
1042,"if not ,  you might consider shaving or the blueant num_extend instead ."
1043,this may be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it .
1044,no more washing the cutting board and the knife .
1045,my favorite so far is santa s buzz which has a limited release .
1046,i got this a little while ago and usually my car chargers die within a couple of months .
1047,"i chose this netgear product over other brands simply because in the past ,  netgear products have always worked flawlessly ."
1048,i also don t get good enough suction to pick anything up  not even my tiny red cherry shrimp poop  .
1049,"if you do wear glasses and headset comfort is an issue ,  then you might want to consider other sets ."
1050,we use this thing at least once a week if not more .
1051,the bra just makes me look like im num_extend
1052,"so i ve ditched these pills now ,  i m on the hunt for something that doesn t disagree with my stomach ."
1053,"great protector ,  it s clear enough that your almost forget it is a cover ."
1054,i recommend this product and would buy it again if the need arose .
1055,"the smc has no provision for wall mounting ,  no bracket for vertical placement ."
1056,"i know plenty of people just use their hands ,  but i m a fan of consistency ."
1057,i also live in an area of high humidity .
1058,"the hand washed beaters are the only thing keeping me from a num_num star review ,  ."
1059,"i m not sure why some people like it ,  but some do ."
1060,it took me a few times to get used to this can opener .
1061,"if the pieces stayed together better ,  it would be much better ."
1062,i do this every time we go on a trip and the unit works very efficiently .
1063,good thing i don t have that problem .  i was surprised .
1064,"and at $ it is much cheaper than the vitamix ,  while also having more horsepower ."
1065,something that has been num_extend start out of num_extend
1066,"good idea to hide the scoop ,  stronger plastic is needed to be more durable ."
1067,"i wouldn t know about that ,  but i do know i m never buying any chebe products again ."
1068,i love stainless because i do not have to worry about temperature and coating deterioration .
1069,"the first is an older model ,  and doesn t have the knob on the top ."
1070,"everything else  clips ,  combs ,  and brushes  is cheap ,  num_extend rate ,  brittle plastic ."
1071,"he sanded down the edges and the case fit fine ,  but after a drop the case was done ."
1072,but excellent results and we are excited to combine this with our camp stove for some great camp cooking .
1073,this one is the one looks great very professional people hear you loud and clear .
1074,if microsoft made this controller different i would like it .
1075,that way the stand can stay in place easily with a carpeted floor .
1076,my hub went online and compared reviews  and beyond amazon  to pick this one .
1077,the milling of the coffee beans is pretty loud .
1078,the controller isn t very comfortable in the hand like a regular video game controller is .
1079,now imagine if that special code didn t exist where you can kill people in just one or two shots .
1080,i will have to use some shims or padding to keep it from wobbling so much .
1081,i wish this larger version had that as it leaves a few  crumbs  when it s set down .
1082,this is the exact same game as the other games .
1083,"it feels loose ,  which takes getting used to ,  but it is actually quite secure when you shake your head ."
1084,"i have ordered this same style shoe ,  same maker in black ."
1085,others said the machine worked well with half the amount of detergent that hoover calls for .
1086,it will work well and even match your covers .
1087,"however ,  every other site s ad says it s an num_extend nimh battery ."
1088,i received this as a wedding gift  my colors were purple .  .  . how perfect !   .
1089,i ll go back to making the trek to whole foods .
1090,"my dog had a hard time getting the food out ,  so there is a lot left in it ."
1091,these glasses are very simple and nice looking .
1092,"could have been great ,  but ended up being almost unusable ."
1093,"great product ,  you will not be disappointed with this set ."
1094,"we have over ten different feeders hanging around the yard ,  and it s obvious which ones are preferred ."
1095,"also ,  it can be a bit hard to remove the case from your phone ."
1096,"yes ,  the shoulder belts are so poorly designed ."
1097,"sure it would be stamped and wouldn t have a full bolster ,  but it would cost $"
1098,i also have the same case and i use mine more often .
1099,they seem to have the same model number as the old one too .
1100,good to have an extra in my travel bag .
1101,i m a hairdresser so a they got a good scrub and rinse .
1102,it s great and my pizza turns out very crispy .
1103,i really think the clip is a great idea .
1104,"luckily ,  i didn t lose any parts and was able to easily secure the cap again ."
1105,"i m definitely not buying these again ,  but i m sure somebody somewhere will enjoy them so i won t waste them ."
1106,"if you are off by even a hair s width ,  it won t fit ."
1107,bucks but amazon should do better than this .
1108,"most everyone i know that has them ,  has the black ones ."
1109,"may not be perfect for music ,  but good enough for me ."
1110,a snap !  i find myself actually enjoying pressing garlic cloves .
1111,i had to downgrade my review for this reason .
1112,the next thing is the entire primer feeding system .
1113,it is almost impossible to do hiit or burst training on this thing .
1114,i have very little problem figuring it out or using it . the battery life is forever .
1115,i have num_num sizes of this coffee pot and i adore them all .
1116,"i used about num_num pockets for earrings ,  and tm saving the larger pockets for bracelets ."
1117,all of the booklets were in the boxes and they were sent from kitchenaid .
1118,i called verizon today thinking it had to do something with their service .
1119,think maybe they re meant for lounging around in super baggy pants .
1120,they performed very well and cleanup was a breeze .
1121,so i had to lower my star rating down to two .
1122,"the controller even has a second channel capability ,  so you can buy and control num_num cars ."
1123,my mind soon changed when i got into the game .
1124,it matches the wood quite nicely and is very comfortable to carry .
1125,"i ve tried different amounts ,  and even the smallest pinch is just too much for me ."
1126,for that reason alone i reappraised it to one star .
1127,when i applied the product i was expecting it to burn .
1128,"however ,  it is simply not a realistic representation of a real horn toad lizard ."
1129,i have gotten a few of these screen protectors .
1130,"the best feature is that if you dry it out after immersing it in water ,  it still works ."
1131,only thing different i would do is buy a cover for it .
1132,i ran the roomba the day after they had been .
1133,"i ve never really reacted well to aspartame at all ,  even with diet sodas ."
1134,"thankfully ,  i have been careful enough to avoid any collision ."
1135,i tried letting it soak in vinegar water but the smell remained .
1136,i hadn t been charging it so that might be why it died .
1137,"you can use it worldwide ,  with any gsm ."
1138,i would have liked more ginger in the taste and less sweet .
1139,little extras can be placed in the side pocket .
1140,these have a great warranty and need very little contunual sharpening .
1141,"like many things that seem too good to be true ,  it was ."
1142,no point of using this for top coat ! will never buy this one .
1143,we wanted the safe edge aspect for the grandkids .
1144,i d liken the quality to that of listening to a call through a blown speaker .
1145,"yes ,  its very very cheap ,  so i thought what the hell ill just buy it ."
1146,"if youre looking at this toy to help develop a love of music ,  get something cheaper ."
1147,slows down to almost nothing in a short time .
1148,it heats up quickly and fits perfectly on a shelf in my cabinet .
1149,bought this for the wife and she loves it .
1150,"i did receive the unit on time ,  and wrote a short statement on prompt service ,  giving five stars ."
1151,i had a storm num_num first it was bad .
1152,the adjust mechanism is actually quite clever and very simple .
1153,"this destabilized the usb lines ,  resulting in repeated system hangs ,  and finally compromised the registry ."
1154,i don t even know where to start !  another thing is the announcer .
1155,"the item i received had light pink trim details ,  not purple ."
1156,i remember that my sister had to have her car serviced and was calling me .
1157,"considering it s pricier ,  i would likely not purchase again because i don t think it adds much ."
1158,"i do like this item ,  but it is definitely an extra ."
1159,"super easy to clean ,  dropped repeatedly ,  super durable ,  no bubbles or malformations or anthing ."
1160,"first leash failed at the lock button ,  so the leash would no longer retract in or out ."
1161,"unless you have mega cup holders in your car ,  they will not fit ."
1162,this west bend model seemed to be just the thing she was looking for .
1163,"then i opened the box and realized that it s the wrong size ,  yet the box says num_extend inches ."
1164,we thought one would need iv fluids because he was getting dehydrated .
1165,"the stand is a pain and takes up too much counter space ,  and i didn t use it ."
1166,i will admit that i have no experience with other calphalon products but this one feels sturdy to me .
1167,it can hold enough soup or food for a big guy like me .
1168,it is not dishwasher safe  :   which is unfortunate .
1169,i ended up getting blisters both times i wore them .
1170,"and they ve put way to many enemies in it ,  i mean way to many ,  even for the game itself ."
1171,you do the math here . this phone is all looks and no substance .
1172,i m very disappointed in case logic for this terrible product .
1173,"both chinchillas were not interested ,  including the one who seems to want to eat almost anything ."
1174,i believe these are a really good value and like how heavy duty the glass and plastic lids feel .
1175,num_extend does not have us in mind !  !  !  we dont exist !  !  !  .
1176,granted it is a very light color but still .  .  .  .  .  .  . if i could give it zero stars i would .
1177,"i will not be buying this product again ,  even if they replace it ."
1178,"the num_num oz size is perfect for a single portion of stew ,  lasagna ,  potpie ,  etc ."
1179,"when i need precision cuts ,  of course ,  i use my kitchen knives ."
1180,i didn t want to spend $ for a good knife .
1181,"its the tacky rubber kind of case ,  and it is very pliable ,  like you can twist it around itself ."
1182,it was impossible to hear them at all in the furthest corner of my yard .
1183,i thought i d try this instead of the glytone % back acne spray .
1184,"they connected easily to my android phone ,  and sounded good with pandora ,  btunes ,  even on phone calls ."
1185,it works just fine and i refuse to replace it with a throwaway item .
1186,"basically ,  you charge the battery pack and forget about charging it for a long time ."
1187,it is just like the original ring and i expect it to last num_num years like the original .
1188,"not sure what i am doing wrong ,  but expected world class pie and my pie came out soggy ."
1189,i did like the color of this cap .
1190,once i finally made an edible pancake there were plenty of air pockets inside of it .
1191,i had to give my first one to my daughter so she could use this awesome handmixer .
1192,"i say just use your phone app ,  it s a whole lot easier ."
1193,they kind of remind me of plain scones with a lack of flavor .
1194,"by the way ,  just to be clear ,  while this is commercial quality ."
1195,some people may have received a better copy .
1196,i can t believe everything i hear but that certainly doesn t win me over .
1197,just give them a chance to make it right .
1198,"i love all my wusthof knives ,  but this one is my favorite ."
1199,"if too many squares get lined up ,  you lose !  !  !  ."
1200,"this seemed liked a great idea ,  but it has a few flaws ."
1201,the kids get them out and toast them in my toaster oven for breakfast on another morning .
1202,i purchased plextor for what i thought was a quality product .
1203,buy the num_num cup or larger if you like your coffee in the larger size mugs .
1204,with so many products for curly hair i ve found that most underperform . i don t like miss jessie s either .
1205,do not buy the cheap crap that is offered elsewhere .
1206,"this game is so complicated ,  that its a drag to play ."
1207,"if i didn t use enough ,  my hair was still frizzy ."
1208,this stores and cleans much much easier than a conventional whisk .
1209,i paid $ and my husband put it together quickly and the cover did go on easily .
1210,i use these tools to dip cake balls or fruit in chocolate .
1211,the bars themselves just don t suit my tastes at all .
1212,i ve had problems with this rotisserie because it smokes from time to time .
1213,i ve dropped my phone a couple of times and the case has fully protected it .
1214,"i have had this cuisinart for about num_num years now ,  and it is still going strong ."
1215,it sticks out from the case and i have to hold it in by hand .
1216,had to bring the target closer to num_num yds before it would work right .

1218,unless you live in a real remote area .
1219,"no matter how wonderful the ingredients ,  it is useless if you can t get it into your pet ."
1220,"it is heavy ,  so the double handles are a plus ."
1221,i noticed if my daughter is in a noisy room .
1222,"one chip  piece  fell off ,  then another and then another :   ."
1223,"i purchased two ,  one for me and one for my husband ."
1224,this is the second bag of lindor milk chocolate truffles that have been extremely disappointing .
1225,"it is easy to use ,  one small potato at a time ,  for a creamy uniform consistency ."
1226,i try not to expect a transcendant experience as you are almost always sure to be disappointed .
1227,"this is a good phone ,  is really fast and slim ."
1228,"in fact ,  this distraction is woven into the gameplay ."
1229,"that s not unique in the world of cookware ,  but this one requires a little babying ."
1230,i was terribly disappointed in them and with amazon s poor packaging .
1231,i should have gotten it when i got my droid x .
1232,"the blender is new ,  so haven t used spares yet ,  but glad i got them !  yea for milkshakes !  ."
1233,"for the money ,  you can t go wrong with this one ."
1234,"the design is so classic ,  so simple and yet so elegant ."
1235,i just drape a kitchen towel over the end which also covers the bowl .
1236,got this for xmas and really love it .
1237,the compressor takes too long to inflate my car tires to the correct pressure num_extend
1238,as in my title of the review this shield is not friendly for the otterbox defender series .
1239,"for the price ,  i d say it s an ok cologne ."
1240,"i went online to motorola and got the proper set of instructions ,  and voila ,  perfect !  ."
1241,i have other wusthof classic knives and they are high quality .
1242,it s a very good buy in this price .
1243,is your num_extend a little too short ?  add another piece of num_extend to it with this coupler .
1244,i was shocked because they used to work so well .
1245,"my hair condition improved ,  my skin and my energy levels did as well ."
1246,"i have had it for num_num days ,  and i am already board ."
1247,so their dirt from num_num people num_extend young kids  and num_num dogs was evident on the carpet .
1248,"as do the effects of the lotion . compared to gold bond lotion ,  this vaseline aloe fresh is inferior ."
1249,other cookie scoops the batter falls right out .
1250,the strips are held between two clear layers of plastic  one layer has a sally hansen logo on it  .
1251,my face time frontal camera works fine with this protector covering it .
1252,"coverage for the ipod s biggest problem ,  its battery ,  is vague ."
1253,"also ,  as soon as you clean it ,  leave it to dry thoroughly before putting it away ."
1254,"in vice city ,  it was a drug deal gone wrong ."
1255,you quickly learn just how much actual work is involved in designing a level that is enjoyable .
1256,bought these based on all the high ratings for my num_num year old granddaughter .
1257,"as most of the other reviewers have said ,  the instructions do take patience ."
1258,lately i ve been doing a lot of cooking .
1259,"they are so cheply made  ,  the car charger did not last more than couple of months ."

1262,"a kind friend gave us these .  .  . for some very special occassion ,  i do not recall ."
1263,i purchased the beef flavor because she loves her beef flavored cat treats .
1264,when you get it make sure every bolt is tight or you will loose it .
1265,don t waste your money on something that doesn t work .
1266,"cost more to return than it is worth ,  so ."
1267,our cat would not eat the purina one so we got him this one .
1268,"i bought it ,  cause my store was out of my regular brand and never again ."
1269,i did purchase it when the green one was on sale for about $
1270,"using my pre ,  the headset voice command will answer and end calls with the voice commands ."
1271,"seriously ,  my initial thoughts were correct and i should have stuck to my guns ."
1272,"i threw away every pack ,  and i hate to waste money ."
1273,recently i thought i would try to find something better .
1274,"however ,  the pocket clip bothered my hands when using the stylus  ,  although i admit they are pretty large ."
1275,no way a few pieces of inadequately formed plastic are worth just under $
1276,"wifi option is great for hotspots and at home with a wireless router ,  esp ."
1277,"with another grand baby on the way ,  the tolo sorter will be passed down to him ."
1278,it does provide a lot of heat quickly .
1279,what more can you ask for ? the shipping date was like num_num weeks out  came early  .

1285,"i don t really need this feature ,  but it is a nice way to keep them together ."
1286,i just hope it stays great  i don t have much faith in products holding up these days  .
1287,i am unable to contact the company because everything is in italian on the website .
1288,i don t think i can drink anymore of it .
1289,"perfect filter for the honeywell ,  just what i needed ."
1290,"looking forward to longevity . the lid looks great ,  fits in shape ,  but it does not snap in ."
1291,"however ,  simply flipping up the flap provides excellent access to the socket ."
1292,these mini candy bars are all a bit gray and definitely very aged .
1293,this battery is a high quality one and has a premium feel to it .
1294,it seems hard to buy a reasonably priced and decent quality product such as this .
1295,i don t know why i put off getting this for so long .
1296,matter of fact it kind of had me stopped up .
1297,well made and feel great on our phones .
1298,"in addition the top comes off completely ,  it s not hinged ."
1299,not sure if my unit was defective or just a horrible product .
1300,bought a second one so now i am going to run the first one in the clothes washer .
1301,"i am in total agreement with matt ,  the other person who rated this a num_extend"
1302,as person who loves to cook i love anything that makes cooking easier .
1303,"by the second day ,  i requested a refund . decided to use cut out storage bins  home made litter boxes  ."
1304,only takes a few seconds and they work fine  .
1305,according to what i viewed on the dr .

1312,i bake with it often and have not encountered any issues .
1313,the controls are horrible and more difficult to deal with than being num_num grand in debt .
1314,"finally ,  the condensation has  blanked out  the clock on two separate occasions ."
1315,once it s attached you can put the pieces back together .
1316,either way i can t imagine them lasting very long .
1317,good luck if your life depends on it !  .
1318,mine was fine when it arrived and i have not had any problems .
1319,"this was very messy ,  very painful ,  and impossible to clean up afterwards ."

1329,"and i will never ,  ever buy another game that uses steam or its ilk ."
1330,it s not to be confused with  monster cable  .
1331,i bought the dyson animal four years ago .
1332,disappointing because he loved the product and was pretty upset when i threw them away .
1333,we don t normally have sensitive skin so that makes me think this product isn t safe for normal users .
1334,how can it ?  the dog has the upper hand .
1335,work perfectly  !  !  easy applicaton and fingerprint resistent  !  minimal bubbles once i adjusted the protector .

1348,i won t get into a battle with words here .
1349,"good question ! first ,  i will say the visuals of the park are excellent ."

1351,"i suppose you could use it for cakes ,  too ."
1352,i get constant lockups and dropped connections on both wan and lan .
1353,"my husband ,  however ,  loves these ,  so a good idea for adults who are still kids at heart ."
1354,"it is easy to use ,  straightforward in all respects ,  and i can be confident my jars are processed perfectly ."
1355,hard not to like at this reasonable price !  .

1367,the fact that this grater cuts both ways doesn t make it  less safe  as stated in another review .

1370,not my favorite and won t be wearing it a whole lot .
1371,you may want to taste your mixture before putting it into the machine .
1372,"my experience may be atypical ,  but the battery on this headset stopped recharging after num_num months ."

1391,the product appears to be of good quality .
1392,you can operate it handsfree by voice command .

1404,it has no intrinsic cleaning power of it s own beyond that of water .
1405,i bought this from another supplier  it s cheaper here at amazon  .
1406,"i remember when bike computers were really expensive ,  but at least those worked ."
1407,i would have thrown my controller down right then and there .
1408,"having your oven tempreature calibrated is essential in cooking ,  this item is very good at doing just that ."
1409,i would order several more but it is useless to me .
1410,i began baking about two years ago and purchased this mixer at the recommendation of my sister .
1411,good for a buck price . the colour layer on the case started leaving after couple of weeks .
1412,it is a tad small and that extra cup would have been perfection .
1413,"i looked at the otterbox choices ,  but in the end i m glad i got the griffin ones ."
1414,"i bought this for my cousin ,  but it fit her phone just fine ."
1415,some bag clips are too narrow and do not effectively close enough of the bag s width .
1416,this is absolutely the best thing for grating garlic and ginger into paste .
1417,"drop the water into a french press containing coarse grounds ,  and four minutes later you have excellent coffee ."
1418,"she loves her rope toys ,  but doesn t like this rubber rope ."
1419,"maybe i should have gotten a num_extend too big ,  i used the butler creek guide . o well ."
1420,they fell out just taking them out of the plastic wrapper .
1421,"first ,  watch how you search for items like  french whip  ."
1422,this is the attachment i use more than any other on my kitchenaid .
1423,"i m on my second pair ,  the first ones were lost ."
1424,i suppose the new rechargeables could be used the same way ?  .
1425,i needed an num_extend two layer cake covered with one inch squares .
1426,the kittens crawled in the hole and it fell apart .
1427,loved it so much i recently bought another one .
1428,this might work great on a very small dog or cat; possibly a guinea pig .
1429,i strongly advice anyone to try a fleet enema before torturing yourself with this stuff .
1430,i highly recommend the num_extend after trying the allegedly  better  and more expensive models .
1431,"by removing the insert ,  i am able to dock my phone even with the protective case still on it ."
1432,"either side works however when it comes to removing time ,  we shall see if i did it correctly ."
1433,not good when this product is going to little kids !  .
1434,he complained of itching and pain . i was worried because he doesn t have terribly sensative skin .
1435,"i like my pants really long ,  and these are not long at all ."
1436,if you are thinking about picking this up i d go for the nintendo gamecube version over this one .
1437,it seems to charge quickly and then chanrged my iphone quickly .
1438,this variety pack is one of the best that mr .
1439,i had mine at all times in the house and it got dirty looking in num_num weeks .
1440,other computers can log on via wireless with no problems .
1441,"final fantasy is ,  and has been for a long time ,  squaresoft s flagship product ."
1442,this case was too good to be true .
1443,"i got the four books ,  and the comic ,  and both cd s ."
1444,save yourself some money and visit the juice aisle at the grocery store .
1445,though i m sure i could have found a tool like that at ulta for cheaper .
1446,it helps make them move more smoothly and it protects them from water .
1447,it will give you a couple of hours of additional time .
1448,this is the only size i didn t have in my collection of pans for wedding cakes .
1449,i should have listened to the reviewers saying this sunscreen is really greasy .
1450,a watched pot never boils  a unwatched pot can boil away .

1452,i also have the same headset paired to my laptop so i can make voip calls .
1453,"one ,  and most important is they sent the wrong size ."
1454,let it ferment longer than the minimum and let it bottle longer than the minimum .
1455,i have one left and it will be gone soon .
1456,"it s nice that they were so thoughtful ,  and the case is decently designed ."
1457,"the sites report the same findings i found in my every day ,  unscientific ,  shooting ."
1458,"being able to fight with your caddy is amusing as well ,  but this game is not worth owning ."
1459,this protector is fine but it is definitely not anti glare .
1460,foam blocks are big and soft; great bonus there .
1461,wayy too much sugar !  you really need to revamp your product .
1462,i just put them on the side of my refrigerator and recycled the rack .
1463,all it had to secure it was the strings that wrap around plastic buttons to hold the box together .
1464,i also had to take away the broken sparkler as tinsel is dangerous for cats .
1465,it s quite heavy but that s what makes it so solid a cooker .
1466,it is made of junky plastic with garish colors .
1467,over all for what i paid for it i would have to say i liked the case .
1468,"as for the shapes i was dissapointed with the selection ,  it is not that great ."
1469,buy yourself a few !  you won t regret it .
1470,the reason that i have two for myselves is that .
1471,dalfour no longer provides a honey packet with each can .

1476,"unfortunately ,  that is not the quality i was looking for ."
1477,"even without resorting to the instructions first ,  unpacking and assembly was simple ."
1478,i have bought several of these for others in the office .
1479,i m going to get one for myself in fact .
1480,army and i wanted to have something that i could easily transport with for field training .
1481,"it is nicely rubberized ,  which gives it a nice grip and feel in your hand ."
1482,this came with bluetooth only and charge cord; no instruction or any other accessories with this .
1483,i tried it a few times and each day i d come home and my skin would hurt beneath it .
1484,something is wrong !  i ve subsequently found other reviewers with the same complaint .
1485,sure it s not num_extend but for a little cutting board it has a nice weight and feel .
1486,don t know where this tea comes from but found two dehydrated human ?  hairs in the bag already .
1487,i had to use the apple camera app to get the mic to work .
1488,these are thin and slip on a wet counter .
1489,i am suprised that canon put its good brand on this item .
1490,it saves space because it can be put in a cabinet unlike the drip coffee maker it replaces .
1491,it is sturdy and provides a quick a reliable charge .
1492,this was the first calphalon pan i bought from amazon over two years ago .
1493,if you have limited storage space consider a smaller model .
1494,"it s actually surprising that it arrived that way ,  because it was packaged so well ."
1495,"basically ,  it won t allow you to enter in your settings ."
1496,it has been great for chopping veggies and i have found it wonderful to use to slice hard cheeses .
1497,after num_num years of minimal use the battery has completely died .
1498,i have a female coonhound i walked on a gl for two years .
1499,they don t seem to work as well as others .
1500,turns out this one was a lot larger .
1501,i read many of the reviews for this product before buying it .
1502,"the previous one is way too soft ,  i returned ,  but this one is tough enough ."
1503,my digital recorder will only recognize num_extend cards and so i was excited to finally find some .
1504,"just a note :  if you have black hair ,  you have to leave it on longer than it says ."
1505,i have been using this thing for about num_num years and loved it .
1506,i ve actually gone to the length of using labels from other mini discs .
1507,a dirty towel can scratch your car s finish .
1508,"your a customer you deserve some respect ,  and should never feal insulted ."
1509,i said  screw it  and bought the more expensive seidio . much better !  i guess you get what you pay for .
1510,i rarely have to drive for hours on end with the headset on anyway .
1511,"in addition ,  the sound quality was not impressive ."
1512,"i do on occasion ,  just pouring it slowly and haven t had a problem ."
1513,i love the looks; at least in the pictures .
1514,"that would be important if riding a bike on the street ,  etc ."
1515,i ve had this kettle for about num_num years and it works just fine .
1516,"it includes a cutter ,  so you don t even need a knife ."
1517,"if it happens to fit you comfortably ,  this is a bargain ."
1518,it is very easy to use and lasts forever .
1519,maybe if the locks were closer to the corners or handle .
1520,the fat drains into the pan and the bacon is nice and crisp .
1521,i didn t like the fact that when i needed to charge my phone i had to take offthe case .
1522,camera eventually came back and has been reliable .
1523,i use it to video my golf swing at the range .
1524,way too small for any dog that is bigger than the average cat .
1525,i use the product as directed but my skin is somewhat dry when i wake in the morning .
1526,"he saw how mine worked ,  and tried to steal it !  so ,  i had to get him his own ."
1527,"however ,  considering you can switch to another battery ,  it s not a nightmare at all ."
1528,so sadly these will not be a treat for my baby .
1529,the drawback to the the thermophore is that it has only one setting :  on or off .
1530,"that night ,  i turned the first knob on ,  like it was on all of my other cooktops ."
1531,i bought this nearly two years ago through amazon as a refurbished unit .
1532,made of bamboo and sealed with some kind of varnish material .
1533,it was not an issue with the older hoses . the newer hoses do not water as evenly as the old .
1534,"i was looking for a basic timer with big buttons ,  a large display and a decent magnet ."
1535,my last try was a famous name deep fat fryer purchased at amazon .
1536,so much for that .  on to the product review : i purchased this product .
1537,i looked in the press and there was more coffee than usual .
1538,the color of this one is a little more green than in the picture .
1539,"and ,  of course ,  without any compass interference ! this belt case has elastic side flaps ."
1540,"and ,  of course ,  if it isn t just right ,  it lets air out of the tire ."
1541,"i ve read endless reviews for breadman ,  zojirushi ,  panasonic ,  etc .  ,  but i think i ll get another breadman ."
1542,"it is so easy to use and makes perfectly popped ,  flavorful popcorn ."
1543,we purchased num_num of these for our cars .
1544,i wasn t sure about some of the rest of the stuff .
1545,the only fun things where hardly ever presented .
1546,this fiesta set is one of thirty colors now available .
1547,neds head does not stay up or in the shape it should be .
1548,it also bored my num_num month old very quickly .
1549,but i really hate the pocket and color because it s a waste of money .
1550,we replaced it with the george foreman grilleration model .
1551,someone needs to correct this before customers give up .
1552,"these headphones are large ,  but they re solidly made ,  and look like an expensive ,  high quality piece of audio equipment ."
1553,the vent setup is so wobbly and unstable that it moved around while i was driving .
1554,"will try the taylor model ,  good luck with analog taylor thermometers ."
1555,"maybe i have a small or narrow head but without a good seal ,  these will not work properly ."
1556,"the watch keeps losing minutes ,  and the light won t come on ,  anymore ."
1557,it makes quick work of otherwise tedious cooking chores . it also sharpens well and is easy to clean .
1558,and what more can you ask of a basic iphone case ?  recommended .
1559,"the water reservoir is removable which i found convenient for filling ,  yet the brew basket ."
1560,came insane sharp and was a very well balanced knife .
1561,i would rather have the galaxy siii unlocked international phone but it is much too expensive .
1562,might as well load up on some colors !  .
1563,i tend to eat pretty healthy though so maybe it works for those who don t like their veggies ?  ?  .
1564,but i returned them because of the waist .
1565,"other coffee makers allow the lid to open without removing it . overall ,  i would not buy this coffee maker again ."
1566,i bought several of these rings and installed them without problems until the other day .
1567,i had suffered through bitter lifeless espresso for num_num years and it was time to go .
1568,"this thing is not heavy duty ,  but it s not super thin like some other cheap bowls ."
1569,i was disappointed because it was quite expensive .
1570,i received the slimx yesterday and am returning it today .
1571,i think this cover has upped my  cool factor  with my family and friends .
1572,thank you for this i hope it helps others out too .
1573,there is a problem with the design of the tabs .
1574,wished i could just get the cable as the ac plug works fine .
1575,guess they download a lot of apps that suck the power down pretty hard .
1576,"well ,  i was wrong . first of all ,  the tip is thicker than picture indicates ."
1577,i was quite satisfied with it until recently .
1578,"i must say ,  i am very pleased with them ."
1579,this did case did not hold up very well .
1580,"however ,  i think this will be a great purchase ."
1581,"i usually love the oxo good grips line of kitchen tools ,  but this one let me down ."
1582,this addition to my tablet gave me a lot more flexibility to share photos with clients or friends .
1583,"the picture on the website made them look clearer and shinier ,  which these were not ! i will return them immediately ."
1584,upon opening the lotion i noticed the old smell of it which is unpleasant .
1585,i personally hate the intrusion on privacy and am hoping for legislation to contain it .
1586,"it worked perfectly ,  almost more like a tiny blender ."
1587,and the belkin usb charging kit is a significantly less expensive than the apple version .
1588,"as an adult gamer ,  i didn t care for this game ."
1589,it is better to just buy a lone wii remote .
1590,works like a charm and makes a perfect poached egg .
1591,"had this product for a couple weeks ,  it works good under primer ,  make up etc ."
1592,"if you don t need it for that ,  then stick to the hose the wind tunnel comes with ."
1593,"it arrived in excellent condition ,  was easy to operate ,  and has performed well ."
1594,"when i make lasagna or a fruit crisp ,  i use a glass or ceramic dish ."
1595,did not use this case much longer than a week .
1596,the broken part is very obviously in need of reinforcement .
1597,these bowls are great for mixing up your favorite cooking ingredients or even light baking needs .
1598,"i ve been using jewelry cleaner for a long time ,  and this one does not work well ."
1599,all i got was a thick slime of reddish plastic coating bonded to the surface .
1600,these hatchets are supposedly made in the us .
1601,the material is firm and sticks almost straight out .
1602,our biggest issue is getting them in and out with shoes on .
1603,"you no longer plan your assualts ,  select your team ,  outfit your team as you see fit ."
1604,the ones that are both a hydrometer and thermometer are a joke too .
1605,i know she will love it and it will look great in her kitchen .
1606,"however ,  i recently dusted off the old num_extend in an attempt to pick up some gems i missed ."
1607,traveled with it thought a busy airport and dropped it .
1608,the video quality was poor with dull colors and vertical lines pulsing from top to bottom .
1609,i have owned a lot of battery packs .
1610,"unfortunately ,  one of our nearest and newest neighbors detests and fears dogs ,  especially bigger ones ."
1611,"it s hard to clip to clothing ,  and you don t know how far you can safely bend it ."
1612,"it is sad because i love their gluten free oats ,  buckwheat cereal ,  flax seed ,  baking powder ,  xanthan gum ,  etc ."
1613,"kind of cool looking for a cheap device . anyway ,  it s light ,  compact ,  cheap ,  and works ."
1614,the one i bought didn t fit and it would have just cost to much to send it back .
1615,but if you want a mirror cover these are very good .
1616,i don t have to worry about loosing my phone or it slipping out .
1617,"i ve always used a jellyroll pan underneath ,  but so far it s just for insurance ."
1618,we had to put it back on already and had it for num_num day only .
1619,this product does not smooth out well so it looks streaky when applied .
1620,"for the price ,  i consider it a great investment !  ."
1621,replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand .
1622,"after careful analysis of the components and construction ,  not impressed ."
1623,"also ,  it s pretty light ,  so it s not tiring to hold or carry your phone ."
1624,this product was touted to be the best lubricant available .
1625,"if i take a few calls ,  the battery life falls off pretty quickly ."
1626,it holds more than the average small processor and is very easy to clean .
1627,"it s a good product ,  but i could do without the sirated edge ."
1628,first plug in the devide to the correct usb slot while the battery is off .
1629,"goog quality ,  works fine and multifunction ,  i used for cuting ,  shreding ,  mixng etc ."
1630,"since it was not made specifically for induction ,  it is not completely flat on the bottom ."
1631,it does a great job of pulling in the cool air from outside and cooling the room .
1632,i had a smaller spinner that would not hold a head of romaine lettuce .
1633,"we will ,  no doubt ,  be purchasing two more when the other two grandsons are out of their cribs ."
1634,this pack seemed perfect !  it was cheap and i would be able to have a variety of teas .
1635,each of the accessories has two little holes in them .
1636,the problem with this seat is me and not the seat itself .
1637,looked like it worked but i had to return the phone before i used it .
1638,it is so easy to do and amazon delivers on their promises .
1639,i carefully read the reviews of all the rice cookers before choosing this one .
1640,i m not so sure if i m ready to give up my conventional corded vacuum cleaner yet .
1641,"it s not sharp enough to do any serious chopping ,  and not very ergonomic for that purpose either ."
1642,"as much as possible ,  i try to buy from amazon products only to avoid headaches ."
1643,it fits over my pans with the handles and i have used it over a large bowl .
1644,"i have owned newtrent chargers for a while !  they were the first available ,  that i was aware ."
1645,would recommend to anyone that cooks with dutch ovens .
1646,it can go in a cabinet between uses and free up counter space for other work .
1647,i would recommend that you make sure your skin can handle this ingredient before purchasing this product .
1648,"the ad says it can handle mega bass ,  but it doesn t ."
1649,it was always a little crooked and wobbly but the real problem is that it s tarnishing my earrings .
1650,"the package also looked like it was already torn into ,  as it was taped up ."
1651,"i couldn t even eat this stuff ,  i had to return it ."
1652,i have  rice bag  and this is quite ugly in my taste and quite stiff too .
1653,"i ve overloaded my racks with lightweight plastic as well as metal utensils ,  potholders and hand towels ."
1654,"it peels right off ,  doesn t harden ,  and isn t even all that glossy unless you put on num_num coats ."
1655,it s not the best pepper mill but it s definitely a decent one with the price .
1656,just hold the inside or outside rings stable  your choice  and turn the other one in the opposite direction .
1657,it got to the point that we were prisoners in our own home .
1658,this is a great bumper and very cheap .
1659,i reported the situation and the lot number .
1660,without this device i could not get through a whole day without one or two items going dead .
1661,"but otherwise ,  i use it all the time to nuke ."
1662,there are places all around the case where it just dosent fit perfectly .
1663,this fan has been absolutely perfect for our needs .
1664,these games have been fully restored on a single gba cart for your portable convenience .
1665,get killed and you lose all your power ups .
1666,"on a rush day ,  i put conditioner in it and go ."
1667,i went to sears and bought one with a self starting timer .
1668,it is light weight and has incredible suction .
1669,i used theirs a few times so i already knew i liked it .
1670,the handle is firm but soft and so easy to use .
1671,i see that many of the problems i experienced have been documented by others here .
1672,"once removed they easily attached to my radar deector ,  which had weak rubber suction cups ."
1673,i spent more time cleaning the phone than using it .
1674,it ll also give you a good idea of how to work everything .
1675,because it only can memoris one front and one back tire setting  .
1676,"i made the mistake of putting dishwashing liquid in it ,  shaking ,  and trying to get rid of the suds ."
1677,so was reduced to sticking my finger with a pin .
1678,"my kids enjoy zoobs soo much more ,  and they are the same price ."
1679,i think i would take a can of that barbasol foam before i used this again .
1680,but pretty satisfied with this battery as of now .
1681,this game is very frustrating i ve destroyed a handful of controllers in the attempt to beat the whole thing .
1682,"since they both only make num_num oz .  ,  i pour all num_num oz ."
1683,it also fit small even though i ordered num_num sizes up .
1684,"this is just a simple spatula ,  but my favorite ."
1685,the large gap allows grease to shoot out in all directions which makes a nasty mess .
1686,keeps you from over serving leftovers that you might want to take for lunch .
1687,i had very high hopes for these dishes .
1688,it must be this style of calvin klein trunks because my other pairs don t have this problem .
1689,makes all tasks painless for my arthritic fingers .
1690,this is both a positive and a negative .
1691,the only gripe i have is that the velcro used to shut the cover doesn t work that well .
1692,i got more of it on my eyelids than my lashes .
1693,"so i said ya know ,  hey maybe it s not so bad ."
1694,i love this product . note that the picture seen here isn t representative of the product .
1695,this is when the food processor really helps not miss the beat on fresh vegetables and fruits .
1696,the tape is very poor quality and thin .
1697,so far the latch others speak of has not broken .
1698,"metal is a bit thinner ,  especially the basket and stem ,  but by today s standards it pretty well made ."
1699,they matched up perfect with my iphone num_extend and the really do protect your phone .
1700,"however ,  i have used the same model for over num_num year ."
1701,and the dealer with which we dealt came through in fine style .
1702,"once you get a decent earhook ,  the blueant num_extend is an excellent choice ."
1703,i was in love with this item at first site .
1704,"i don t want sugar and artificial sweeteners . also ,  these bars are pretty high in fat ."
1705,we liked this otter box as it works exactly as described .
1706,the  lip  at the top of the pan prevents the viscous liquid from coming out by gravity when tilted .
1707,it is bulky and you re better off getting a small lock box instead of this .
1708,"contact the manufacturer if you aren t sure ,  even if it s an approximation it s better than nothing ."
1709,if you need a new battery this is not the battery you should buy .
1710,"in that time ,  i ve had to take several tests as i am irregular and not taking birth control ."
1711,the iphone and android cannot match the power of microsoft s office num_num which integrates with microsoft phone perfectly .
1712,"finally ,  the opportunity to not knock my cell phone off the treadmill ."
1713,anybody want to buy a set of totally babied henckels ?  i need more knives i like to use .
1714,"it removed the first grease stain completely ,  saving my $ shirt ."
1715,"for the past few weeks that i ve been testing this device ,  it has done this flawlessly ."
1716,the lens broke and then were thrown awaya waste of money .
1717,you can t beat the price on these cords especially when they even offer free shipping .
1718,i use this pin for rolling out pie crusts .
1719,i had these in my cart to purchase for a trip .
1720,"very poorly made ,  poor design and not worth the money ."
1721,read before buying !  !  i m so upset !  because it is not worth the money they ask for it !  .
1722,"when i pull the gun out of my pocket ,  the holster comes with it ."
1723,i hated these as soon as i put them on .
1724,the wrinkling is slight and right across the center .
1725,i just got the whisk in the mail today and was very happy with the purchase .
1726,"i paid about $ for the beehive ,  and i love it more than ever now ."
1727,"flip it around the other way ,  and tiny pegs push debris out of the tiny holes ."
1728,i put my phone through its paces and have had to replace the cover a few times .
1729,i subsequently ordered the same item from samsung an it is working great .
1730,"a few crashes here and there ,  but i ve learned to save often ."
1731,gave it to a friend who is really into gel nails .
1732,litter sticks to it like glue .  .  . even the super duper dr .
1733,"i tested it out with a few other handsets and an num_extend player ,  and it gripped everything well ."
1734,the suction cups did not stick to our tile wall very well at all .
1735,yes i had to connect it to my phone .
1736,the unit no has moisture and corrosion and has died .
1737,i think that an inner seal is missing for the lid of the carafe .
1738,it comes with a wide rubber gasket to prevent any leakage .
1739,my family has had a set of farberware classic pots and pans for over num_num years .
1740,my dog ate off the original black collar so i found a wide ribbon to tie it back on .
1741,reverse osmosis removes almost all of the dissolved impurities in well or tap water .
1742,my face became dry and cracked within the first use .
1743,first of all if you have a short torso and small boobs than this outfit is for you .
1744,"is like mikey ,  he hates everything that looks or tastes like hard dog food ."
1745,"as the other reviewers stated ,  this is literally just a stand ."
1746,"someone sell me a comfortable ear piece that works in the car ,  please ."
1747,"he was really excited with it ,  until we started to actually use it ."
1748,unlike many other styli this has a comfortable weight to it and thicker body  think jumbo crayons  .
1749,i have a small oven and it s hard to find a good solid roasting pan that will fit .
1750,"even after reading all the forum posts and reviews ,  trying everything mentioned ,  it does not open correctly ."
1751,"i have tried steaming veggies on top of the rice ,  and that works great ."
1752,"as long as they pee only in the breeze ,  i love it ."
1753,"i m not very fond of the thin ,  removable earloop the num_extend has ."
1754,"he said if it did not work ,  to call him back for options ."

1756,"our more graceful ,  thinner one was fine in the dishwasher and lasted until i dropped it on the floor ."
1757,"it takes my sprint and att phones from almost no signal ,  to one or two bars ."
1758,so these pills did cause me a bit of stomach upset .
1759,i literally could not get this on past my upper thighs .
1760,"both were purchased through amazon . com ,  and off the same link ."
1761,i usually soak it for a fewhours before i can get it clean .
1762,hasn t caused me any trouble yet and works very well .
1763,"i was really skeptical about buying this battery ,  i thought it wouldn t work ."
1764,you ll see how num_extend is a step in the wrong direction .
1765,"it is a great omelet pan ,  a handy pan for toasting pine nuts ,  etc ."
1766,i had to call num_extend wireless and waited about num_num minutes before i got a representative .
1767,"i think most people will be fine with the sound ,  but more discerning listeners should look elsewhere ."
1768,"my biggest complaint ,  and one of safety ,  there is a large spark created when unplugging the thing ."
1769,"this product did not feel very moisturizing ,  but it made me break out ."
1770,turmeric is difficult to absorb so bioperine black pepper fruit extract  and bromelain are added to enhance bioavailability .
1771,you have to be real picky to notice this first one but i am so here we go .
1772,"the aluminum alternatives work just as well on any given piece ,  but they have to huge flaws ."

1782,"this was a great toy ,  for the first num_num minutes ."
1783,"this is a fantastic charger ,  it comes with a micro usb cord about num_num feet long ."
1784,there both plenty powerful and big enough for any home uses .
1785,could it be cardboard ?  this may be the last pair of rockports that i buy .
1786,i run it through the dishwasher and it does not seem to mind .
1787,i saw this set and found it to be well priced and just what i needed .
1788,"it s slim compared to the others i ve seen , used or what i have ."
1789,they are not exactly the same as the apple usb cable  to be expected  but it still worked .
1790,i had the plantronics num_num and people often told me that i sounded staticky .
1791,you ll have to put some pressure on the lid to get it to flatten out .
1792,the curve in the blade is also perfect for everything from mincing to slicing .
1793,"which is great !  you control which oil is used ,  the amount of salt ,  butter other toppings ."
1794,since it was too late to return it to amazon i called cuisinart .
1795,"stick with a regular blender for milkshakes and drinks ,  and save some money and counter space ."
1796,one other odd problem i had was with the music player .
1797,its still usable and pretty much protects my droid .
1798,"it has temperature settings ,  for correct temperature cooking and see through cover work great ."
1799,i was worried about placing them in the microwave and they cracked over time in the freezer .
1800,initally she seemed to do fine but then began getting very loose stools .
1801,the following night he pointed out that there were deep red lines where the belt and it s folds were .
1802,so to me it is a pretty useless toy .
1803,my mistake is that i cut the upc code too early and can t return this item any more .
1804,i m planning to give one as a gift this summer .
1805,this item arrived quickly and was packed well .
1806,the case is easy to put on and remove .
1807,i bought this pan specifically for the lid .
1808,kept it on num_num day than removed it .
1809,"it also has a somewhat oily texture ,  which i was not a fan of ."
1810,i have used a couple of types of velcro cable ties in the past .
1811,"if it had tasted badly but still gave solid results ,  i would just choose another flavor ."
1812,hangs many ties in a relatively small footprint .
1813,"some people have had perfectly fine num_extend connections ,  and great for them ."
1814,"great way to hear something  music ,  podcast ,  audio book ,  video  from any portable device ."
1815,i have the same pair of pants that are the exact same number but are different .
1816,the damage has been done to my snails .
1817,"but when i got it ,  the chrome buttons broke as soon as i pressed them ."
1818,"so if you are petite ,  this may work for you ,  otherwise keep looking ."
1819,"a few of the kitties played with them on the floor ,  but they don t eat them ."
1820,i threw the last two of this flavor away rather than forcing myself to use them .
1821,"what s wrong with num_num you ask ?  everything !  this is not futbol ,  futebol ,  soccer ,  calcio or anything remotely near it ."
1822,my only criticism is that the biggest one isn t big enough to hold a whole box of cereal .
1823,on those mornings when the batteries run down you will plug in the cord and therefore be using ac .
1824,great price and great replacement battery for my droid charge .
1825,the felt disintegrates and then the rubber ball splits into two pieces .
1826,i always thought paper filters were a pain .
1827,i have num_num of them that i purchased over num_num years ago .
1828,good luck getting your dog to take these .
1829,"unfortunately ,  these headphones cannot stay in tune no matter how close the headset is to the base ."
1830,the person on the other end never complains .
1831,"since i don t care for a course grind ,  the mill workes easily and the grind was perfect for me ."
1832,great fit on the phone and great look on the phone she loves it .
1833,"this lasted two uses for me ,  and then the red brush part detached ."
1834,"i put it away for the summer ,  and brought it out again this summer ."
1835,i just recently received the rio num_num for a father s day gift .
1836,i recommend that we all get new batteries .
1837,so hard that in my opinion they are unusable as shipped . the solution is as follows .
1838,especially as i am not aware of the arctic brand .
1839,"i ll pay more ,  but i ll like what i m getting ."
1840,my oh my !  this is the thing to have .
1841,"if you have extremely sensitive skin and can find no other sunscreen ,  you might want to try this product ."
1842,"high quality charger ,  appears to be genuine motorola ."
1843,all blades and stems from these two models can be used back and forth .
1844,allows for the cable to be fed through the back holes and under the iphone .
1845,this is my first ipod touch case for my first ipod touch .
1846,and still trojan horses would infect the server .
1847,not worth getting if you have a strong chewer .
1848,but be careful if you are heading out for a long ride because these will not do the job .
1849,"it s a nice try ,  but remove the sugar and it s probably gonna be okay ."
1850,"it does the job well ,  and would be great for a small home ."
1851,i had to spin the belt around to the side to get it to work .
1852,"if the color you want is offered by uag ,  pay extra for it ."
1853,hurts like crazy the zapping is way too strong that i can t use it .
1854,surprised how many items on amazon do not provide that .
1855,this is only one of my moments where i needed it .
1856,"it worked great ,  the cake turned out great and everyone was very happy !  !  ."
1857,i have to pay my mortgage not there s !  .
1858,"consequently ,  i needed to replace the current door ."
1859,before i wrote this review i wanted to test that .
1860,it was the only one in the store he had ducked into .
1861,"i didn t buy it here ,  but i paid about the same price and it is the same model ."
1862,"the brush hairs are rough and don t pick up color ,  cream or powder ."
1863,its a quality swiss knife and i would buy it again for someone else .
1864,still has batter life after charging the iphone which sucks for battery life .
1865,i stayed away from those bc i didnt want to add lead to my diet .
1866,i purchased this case for my boyfriend and he loves it .
1867,"after num_num years of marriage ,  i have owned several toaster ovens ."
1868,"it s insurance ,  right ?  do you ever get your insurance money back ? in this case ,  lord ,  i hope not ."
1869,that is the only fault with this unit .
1870,"i have now built up my collection with mostly sigma and coastal scents brushes ,  a few mac ."
1871,"oh ,  and also ,  it is not a very good consistency ."
1872,it makes my kitchen counter clutter free and i stopped running out to the outdoor recycle bin as often .
1873,"i bought these through ll bean ,  hoping to improve my side visibility on my bike ."
1874,i am debating whether or not to return this utterly worthless item .
1875,it will kick dirt and debris around all over the place though .
1876,they enjoyed being able to see it iwhile the ice cream was making .
1877,this is one of listings for them here on amazon .
1878,"so ,  from time to time ,  we have to replace things ."
1879,bought for the our church to go with our new bunn coffee pot .
1880,"they fit right into the grove of the num_extend barrel ,  however ,  that is not the part that gets dirty ."
1881,"my bathroom sink was covered in dye ,  and i m pretty sure it s stained ."
1882,it s scratched up  used  and the cord is shorter .
1883,"added a little to the length ,  but still shorter than some cases with no battery ."
1884,in another two years you ll be buying a better version of the lite as well .
1885,he has never been interested in cuddling or using it in pretend play .
1886,works well and cleans up well in the dishwasher .
1887,"earlier ,  i also found out this mouse will not work with black mousepads ,  even brand new mousepads ."
1888,but i will probably take it away from him .
1889,the only good games for sega is sonic te hedgehog .
1890,this is the best num_extend pan i have every owned .
1891,it seems almost impossible to stay stealthy in this game which is what metal gear is all about .
1892,"this was easy to install ,  looks great and holds a lot of stuff ."
1893,not a lot to say but it works .
1894,"but while we were on the phone a bunch of sirens went by ,  very close ."
1895,"these are flimsy ,  falls out of glass ,  easily breaks ."
1896,so i may purchase a separate pot for that .
1897,i m going to be back to my trusty scissor .
1898,i bought my first one from target and couldn t find it again and then found it here .
1899,i bought one like this several years ago .
1900,got this espresso maker when my old one broke .
1901,"it was not too sweet ,  very chocolaty ,  and definitely full of hazelnuts ."
1902,"i have recommended it to family and friends ,  and am hoping to someday own a bowl or two ,  also ."
1903,a few hours later it was working again with no signs of water damage .
1904,it s basically the same build quality as the iphone num_extend or iphone num_extend
1905,spread some cream cheese in the bottom of the dish .
1906,the kettle has developed a serious leak where the copper bottom is joined to the steel top .
1907,i bought this to lock up my bikes while on the bike rack on my van .
1908,it leaves the cat with a light pleasant smell .
1909,"the pieces fit tightly ,  so you will need a hammer ."
1910,i did not have patience to read any instructions and found it difficult to navigate .
1911,"but here on earth ,  the smallest breeze was enough to knock it out of the vertical ."
1912,it doesn t protect all the side of the phone bc i got scratches now .
1913,but it has broken too many times for my tastes .
1914,i bought these and do not regret them .
1915,"no hiss ,  no dropouts ,  no lost signals and a lot cheaper ."
1916,my doctor said this product is dangerous and has never been proven to result in weight loss .
1917,i ended up returning this item because i was so disappointed .
1918,i received one last year as a gift and love it .
1919,"after one cycle it didn t do anything for me ,  and i doubt i would be trying it again ."
1920,shampoo doesnt lather and the conditioner smells like crap .
1921,i will be buying sheets in different sizes .
1922,i m not sure if it has something to do with the  live  desktop that i use .
1923,even if the consistency was good it still has a bad taste .
1924,make sure your grind can not fit thru the brew screen .
1925,it came in a nice double foam package surrounded by clear plastic .
1926,"also ,  the battery capacity degraded over time so that it lasted barely any longer than the stock battery ."
1927,it s thin plastic and there are toolboxes that cost half as much that are twice as sturdy .
1928,"figure on about num_num largish mugs . initially ,  i was concerned about the other reviewers complaints about the plastic top ."
1929,and that is exactly how to use this device .
1930,they would not even stretch under my car seat .
1931,num_extend for getting all cookies same size for even and efficient baking .
1932,it was very frustrating so i to return it .
1933,it was shorter than expected but perfect for use when i m cooking in my fireplace .
1934,i m going to have to splurge and get him something really nice .
1935,not when you buy it and try it yourself .
1936,my family shares this charger and the extra batteries with it and they work great .
1937,the vacuum does a great job on filtering dust and preventing it from entering the air during use .
1938,i think it s classy easy clean up and you can see what your doing .
1939,she was almost unable to catch it even though she easily catches smaller fabric frisbees .
1940,"others may prefer the aeron ,  i know i liked it ."
1941,no sign of rust on the metal carrier .
1942,i did have trouble with it one time after charging .
1943,i needed a larger one to be able to cook larger portions .
1944,"but as soon as he bumps it ,  or tries to move it everything falls apart ."
1945,"if you like the oreo cremes and are minty ,  you ll probably like these ."
1946,very sharp but sometimes a little difficult to peel a beet at certain angles .
1947,i only use these pads when it s raining outside or very cold .
1948,i had to return this and pay another num_num bucks to get the right ones .
1949,"the spots did lighten somewhat ,  but no different than they do when i regularly apply sunscreen ."
1950,this one fit the bill and looked pretty good .
1951,i ve had a couple of different plugs and they all worked .
1952,"i probably wouldn t use this in a bathroom ,  but it is perfect for the kitchen ."
1953,"you can charge your phone in your backpack ,  briefcase ,  or whatever ."
1954,"the artisan bowl is tall and narrow ,  well designed ,  less splashes ."
1955,it s easy to use and clean and pours very nicely .
1956,i will now purchase the other books so i can learn more .
1957,i love this pan i have been using now for about a month and had no problems .

1961,this is only good if it smells good .
1962,"this game has had one of the most epic ,  and glorious music scored for a video game ."
1963,it cuts down on waste and difficulty of opening their packaging .
1964,i have decided to give it away today .
1965,the battery and cover fit with no problem .
1966,some men are good at what they do at work .
1967,"other than that ,  it was cute ,  but unless you are a child ,  i would not purchase !  !  !  ."
1968,fits tight and seems to be made of good quality .
1969,anker makes great products and this battery is no exception .
1970,i am satisfied with this less expensive earbuds .
1971,"if so ,  more power to you and you should get this mug ."

1973,"it is a comfortable ballpoint pen ,  and initially nothing special ."
1974,i have used this for the full num_num weeks and nothing about my eyelashes are different .
1975,very misleading and not safe if your child weighs more .
1976,"i am health conscious ,  but now a daysbudget conscious takes precedent ."
1977,hopefully you would not get the dim idea of putting a small lock on it .
1978,my daughter only likes to play with the fairy doll by itself without the rest of it .
1979,the push top locks into place so it takes up less space .
1980,i failed to recognize the fact that the cups were the size of my usual purchase .
1981,what i liked about the product was that it was simple and easy to store .
1982,even with lip gloss on top i wasn t happy .
1983,and it is much easier to apply than greasing and flouring .
1984,this quickly faded as i realized what a stupid little toy this really was .
1985,she has some tendonitis problems and i thought this might be just the ticket .
1986,"however ,  the company helped me resolve the issue and returned my money to me ."
1987,i did num_num passes on all my rugs and there was a huge difference .
1988,they were exactly what i wanted and what i needed .
1989,i take the brew  n go on our car trips because i prefer it to the hotels  coffee pods .
1990,now it s sort of half silver and half brass looking .
1991,"if you re making apple dumplings ,  pie ,  etc it makes the apples look very  professional  ."
1992,"to make the recipe as directed ,  i needed a large stockpot and this it ."
1993,"i tried making this product using two of the methods prescribed on the box ,  i . e ."
1994,"what the listing doesn t tell you ,  is that the dosage is num_num tablets num_num times daily ."
1995,"ok ,  i hate to leave negative feedback ,  but frontline just doesn t work ."
1996,when i read over both cookbooks that just about both do the same job .
1997,"and that attracts ants ,  armies of tiny ,  biting ants ."
1998,i cannot imagine wearing them for any extended period of time . so i sent mine back .
1999,boils water quickly and is extremely easy to use .
2000,this appears on the outside to be a nice clean little machine .
2001,instead it confines the pee and keeps it off my dog s paws .
2002,"it is pretty deep inside ,  enough to put two loaves side by side and something on top as well ."
2003,the cheap thin glasses you get at other stores always broke .
2004,i was horrified when i opened the package and it smelled like it was made out of toxic chemicals .

2008,we purchased another pair in a different color .
2009,"the bed sheds little balls of wool constantly ,  and they end up all over the house ."
2010,if i had had to do this  by hand  i would be crippled and it would have taken forever .
2011,the better deal is alpine swiss classic leather business card wallet .
2012,they have a cheap feel to them like they would break if you drop them .
2013,"also ,  the sound gets distorted if you have the volume all the way up ."
2014,no setting change would make this better . forget about linux support for the num_extend card .
2015,would do a great job chopping herbs or small veggies .
2016,this item did not quite look how i imagined it would .
2017,"it s cute ,  the red color is the right shade ,  the logo looks good ,  and it fits ."
2018,i see it lasting a long time too .
2019,they are very light and don t make my ears stick out at all .

2027,it s a thin straight piece of plastic with a small hook on the end .
2028,"i pushed it in one time ,  then pulled it out ."
2029,these reasonably priced ear buds do the job .
2030,they don t look big but they let the water thru to quickly and my coffee comes out pretty weak .

2032,this is better for the phone battery and it save additional juice .
2033,"i had been wanting a deep dish pizza pan for awhile ,  and finally splurged ."
2034,i use them for single servings of soup and salad .
2035,"also ,  some good looks wouldn t hurt . pros :  fits very tight to phone ,  it is hard to get off ."
2036,"positioning not as versatile as i would like ,  but it appears to be all it was advertised to be ."
2037,also it won t brake as the bottle could because it is plastic .
2038,i fixed mine with power putty .  .  .  . shouldn t be necessary with a new product .
2039,i get that they are better for the spice containers though .
2040,"i liked this case because it was a simple ,  clean ,  and nice looking case ."

2050,"mirror part is good ,  but you cannot see your screen as they say you can ."
2051,the battery has lasted for everything we have wanted to use it for so far .
2052,getting the num_num bit wep configuration to work required asking a consultant for help .
2053,"when it cuts to the core ,  the gameplay itself ,  it is quickly satisfying ."

2056,i have oily eyelids and thought to get this so my eyeshadow would stay put all day .
2057,"i purchased these for my husband ,  who unfortunately didn t like them ."
2058,"although they do not recline ,  they are silent ."
2059,it never gave me any energy and i wasted an entire day in bed trying to feel better .
2060,i m strong enough to hang onto a num_extend crystal bowl and i was paying full attention .
2061,perfect for filling muffin tins with batter and for making nice size meatballs .

2071,and the precision of the fit and finish is a joy to behold .

2090,my dog can chew through a medium num_extend rawhide in a couple of hours .
2091,you have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform .
2092,it protects the phone very well but the red part needs to be made better for a better fit .

2094,it looks so go i use it on the counter top .
2095,"i didn t have any problems with assembly or disassembly ,  both were easy ,  and it seemed pretty sturdy ."

2109,"the gameplay was a horrible mixture of repetition ,  poor graphics ,  and an absurd level of difficulty ."
2110,it seemed to have problems saving it . the reset button is wonky . don t buy it .
2111,"we have used this for a few months now ,  and i am reasonably pleased with it ."
2112,this eyeliner pretty much starts melting from from your eyes the minute you put it on .
2113,braun s are great quality but grossly over priced .

2124,"but it was so runny ,  it went everywhere !  it seems it has too much water in it ."
2125,"i wash these in the dishwasher ,  but i don t use the heated dry option ."

2173,"after several tries ,  on areas with various hair textures ,  i m giving up on it ."
2174,"the stainless steel basket ,  lid and stem all seem of adequate quality ."
2175,it has quickly become my favorite of the num_num i own . reasons i like it : the cord is long .
2176,than you already know how wonderful and flawless these products are .
2177,handle has protection and the small size is great for a few eggs and heating up quickly .

2193,be a man and buy the gransfor bruks scandinavian forest axe .
2194,"the slot ,  yes slot not slots as it looks like ,  will hold a credit card and your id easily ."
2195,my daughters room is decorated with a  fishy  theme .
2196,rinse well to remove powder residue from the ajax or towel dry .
2197,i just ordered another one in both sunflower yellow and cinnabar .
2198,fit two sets of dishes and the platter one fit a few all wrapped in towels .
2199,"it worked as a basic moisturizer ,  that s it ."
2200,"not from dirty hands ,  from the material they used ."
2201,"this one will do if you want something small and reliable ,  but not if you expect much humidity ."
2202,but if you live in the city and you don t have a fence and there are children around .
2203,it grinds coffee beans fast !  it isn t too large in size making it nice to sit on the counter .
2204,but i don t know if it will be a goodand easy as mine !  .
2205,it would be nice if a model was available with a power dock .
2206,there has been no big problem getting the core out of the slicer like some have commented on .
2207,"this did absolutely nothing ,  brassy tones are not reduced at all ."

2217,"if you re vacuum breaks twenty years from now ,  they ll give your money back or give you a new model ."
2218,the wax also makes the leather appear darker and more vibrant . i still recommend trying on multiple sizes before purchasing .
2219,only complaint is that rainbow color stain after washing .
2220,i ve owned this player for at least four years .
2221,"they have a sparkle to them ,  are tight and are ,  in my opinion ,  more feminine ."
2222,"if you like for developers to expand on ideas and actually try to improve their games ,  look elsewhere ."
2223,"corer worked nicely ,  was easy to do ,  easy to get the core out of it ."
2224,i use it as a plate setter  heat deflector  in my komodo charcoal bbq .

2226,i imagine this product to be great for women since they can easily store this in their purses .
2227,"excellent rating from reviewers here :  num_extend stars !  my rating is five stars ,  and i am no troll ."
2228,"if you turn off your gameboy and turn it on again ,  you start at level num_num again ."
2229,i think a product s effectiveness is based on how it is being used .
2230,"it was made to look that way ,  no doubt ."
2231,"and i haven t even worn it yet ,  and it s coming apart ."
2232,"whenever the batteries are installed ,  it is on ."
2233,if you need the most protection available for an num_num series this is it bar none .
2234,the genius who configured this mess ought to have his shins slapped by baseball bats all day long .
2235,you have to constantly change the settings to get a half decent picture .
2236,if you re looking for a very protective case then this one should work very well for you .
2237,"none of them worked ,  at all . i have read the reviews here for tips and tried different placements ,  etc ."
2238,this is my first time using an air purifier .
2239,both lasted less than a year and they both had intermittent failures .
2240,"inside ,  the water opening is very small and difficult to reach ."
2241,"i was ,  after much effort ,  able to install it using the vista driver available from belkin ."
2242,it protected my phone long snuff till i received my personalized case ! the color is cute as well .
2243,"i will go back to biolage ,  i thought this was a little cheaper so i bought it ."

2245,what can i say about a fry pan screen .
2246,fell apart before i could really even use it .
2247,i find this no harder to wash than if i had to wash num_num seperate tupperware containers .

2252,this is normal when you use anyting that heats up for the first time .
2253,"i bought this as a christmas gift ,  for my adult grandson ,  who loves to cook ."
2254,i personally don t think killing animals for leather is an ecologically responsible action .
2255,they shouldn t advertise it for a service that is no longer provided .
2256,"if you like convinience ,  then this is the trash can for you ."
2257,"it worked great for the first num_num months ,  then it quit without a warning ."
2258,after only a day my kids have already lost interest in them because they won t work properly .
2259,i bought my first scanpan over num_num years ago .
2260,i am very glad that i decided to order these .
2261,"i am a huge fan of the entire silent hill game series ,  especially num_extend"
2262,"this one is easy to set ,  press in the numbers on the num_num little buttons ."
2263,what irritated me was in the instructions it stated to  use the included bubble remover  which didn t exist .
2264,this is a nice quality product and a good fine mesh .
2265,i doubt there is anyway to get my money back at this point .
2266,i imagine it was putting too much pressure on the buttons .
2267,don t forget to shut it off after the timer goes off .
2268,"it s a fine watch ,  but don t rely too much on the  water resistant  label ."
2269,the gap is able to make me use my phone as a gps .
2270,this review for deep facial cleanser for sensitive skin .
2271,"you also need to sit the basket with the coffee properly ,  in the niche of the machine ."
2272,i always have great experiences with anker batteries .
2273,i really wish i had read the reviews before ordering .
2274,"and with all of the use the kindle gets ,  i find i frequently have to recharge ."
2275,"after reading review after review ,  i decided on the cuisinart chef s classic cookware ."
2276,i purchased the red because i wanted to add a touch of color in the kitchen .
2277,"after purchase ,  i checked amazon and saw the reviews and figured it would not last ."
2278,impressive to say the least .  .  . especially in remote parts of new jersey and while moving in a vehicle .
2279,"you can use it to play ,  to move objectes and to mark words ."
2280,i have made at least num_num loaves of bread in this now .
2281,and the wood has a nice rich tone so it actually looks good .
2282,"it is easy to clean ,  not too bulky ,  perfect size for an individual mug ."
2283,it gives substance to such a small phone .
2284,"i have bought many lotions off of amazon and have never been ripped off ,  until now ."
2285,"great fiesta piece at a great price  when i purchased it ,  anyway  ."
2286,i noticed no effects and it s pretty thin and runny .
2287,first off bp medical supplies took awhile to ship .
2288,i would recommend these items to one and all .
2289,"but not in a fun advanced ai sense ,  where you feel the joy of battle ."
2290,the protection is visible when the screen is off .
2291,"it s hit or miss depending on your load  whether lead shot ,  bismuth ,  steel ,  or buckshot  ."
2292,maybe i just need to stick to tea .
2293,i think i got it for an exceptional price and was not disappointed with one single thing .
2294,"however with it being so dull ,  it hardly compares ."
2295,"also ,  the separation problems cannot be easily overcome in a little packet like this ."
2296,"his presentation ,  and creativity far surpassed my ability ."
2297,it also helps to keep it in your shirt pocket if you carry your phone there .
2298,here are some of its num_extend very well made .
2299,the official youtube appliation ?  yours for a nominal fee .
2300,i gave this to my husband who does our cooking .
2301,"they are so rough and scratchy !  !  carter s undies are really soft cotton ,  but these are such terrible quality ."
2302,"this one is made of plastic ,  thick flexible plastic ."
2303,this product does exactly what i want it to do .
2304,been wanting to try these for a while .
2305,"i m all about stevia sweetened soda ,  of which there are two ,  zevia and blue sky ."
2306,it seems that all this darkness means little attention must be paid to the actual graphics .
2307,i like another reviewer had a bad experience with the cinnamon flavored trident gum .
2308,"it s worth the price of investment to learn how to take bp manually ,  but with good equipment ."
2309,"so for chopping things fast if somewhat inconsistent in size ,  this is great ."
2310,i thought there would not be any fitting issue since num_extend had been release more than num_extend
2311,"to me ,  this is one of those games that are addictive but boring ."
2312,i will have to try other brands of popcorn that are heavier and see if that works better .
2313,the reviews are what made me buy these corn holders .
2314,"they say if something is priced too good ,  buyer beware ."
2315,maybe the seller is selling older stock socks .
2316,"both record on num_extend hard disks ,  and both burn dvds ."
2317,i m not buying any more games with  digital rights management  or drm .
2318,ugh !  save your money if your dog is an extreme chewer .
2319,the included recipes are a very helpful start for a device i only thought about using for coffee drinks .
2320,the fan blade is a turbo prop style blade like found on small aircraft .
2321,the controls are pretty good but you won t need them because all you use is the x button .
2322,i guess thq attempted to fix their previous story problems from num_extend and num_extend by offering very brief scenarios .
2323,you can t beat the price for all the items you receive in this set .
2324,if you can stop at num_num or num_extend you should be fine .
2325,the first time it worked great but the battery door chipped easily .
2326,also protects camera lens that sticks out from inspire .
2327,the popcorn pops too fast for the butter to sufficiently melt .
2328,"so ,  i went back and ordered the next size up in waist ."
2329,i bought the set used and then had $ in points so i got the set for $
2330,"then ,  i thought it was a virus ,  or my sinuses ."
2331,my hair does not feel freshly shampooed and therefore i actually forget that i washed it .
2332,the second one i purchased for our rv and it broke the second time i used it .
2333,there isn t a single negative about this bread machine .
2334,i purchased this spice rack as a gift because it looked so pretty and practical .
2335,i would not buy it again nor recommend it to anyone .
2336,"i ordered this product to give it a try ,  even there s a lot of bad reviews on the website ."
2337,synthetic vitamins may actually do more harm than good .
2338,therefore i can not comment on the unit .
2339,i use raw stevia and will stick to it and natural flavors .
2340,turns out that it tastes just like apple juice .
2341,i honestly don t think it s worth the money .
2342,i have found that trumark makes the best tubular bands .
2343,"when the game works ,  it is pretty decent ."
2344,"this app alone turns your phone into an absolute beast ,  with response times that rival even the iphone ."
2345,i bought num_num of these usb wall outlet chargers .
2346,no more using towels or pot holders to hold the handles on my cast iron pans .
2347,that doesn t bother me since i prefer to grind my coffee right before i make it anyway .
2348,"it holds my evo safely ,  looks nice and does the trick ."
2349,"that may also be because i thoroughly rinse the rice before cooking it ,  i m not sure ."
2350,"the box has a good cutter ,  which makes it more convenient ."
2351,the only bad thing about the cooker is that it s way too expensive to buy online .
2352,also somewhat different flavor and packaging than i remember years ago at the grocery .
2353,"however ,  it is better than most other popcorn poppers i have owned ."
2354,sent both back and decided to stick with my dansko s .
2355,make sure your cat likes catnip before you buy this product .
2356,we use it as a companion to our blendtec to pulverize flax to be added to our smoothies .
2357,"like many ,  i have a jawbone era headset and i purchased these to make the experience more pleasant ."
2358,"however ,  i am now fairly certain that this repeatability is false ."
2359,we bought these for our dog to help her  woo sah  in the stressful time of our move .
2360,i also think the finish is easier to clean than in past models .
2361,the flimsy earhook and weakness with wind are the only reasons i give this four vs .
2362,"version with warranty  silver   ,  as most bluetooth headsets are ."
2363,then i would change to the cutter and cut all of the rolled pasta .
2364,"coffee didn , t taste right ,  kind of tinny and had grounds in the coffee cup ."
2365,this really cooks things up good and really cleans up nice once you have used it several times .
2366,"i then slice through the onion for the first cut ,  cutting between the steel posts ."
2367,"after hearing how wonderful calphalon was ,  i couldn t believe how poorly it preformed ."
2368,num_num gr of protein for each serving of now foods unflavored whey protein isolate without any chemicals or additives .
2369,and no oven spritzing needed or pan of boiling water in oven is necessary .
2370,first time order of these protectors and will not buy them again .
2371,kahu repeats every statement made to him back in the form of a question .
2372,my cat has barely looked at this thing .
2373,i have a queen size air bed and it works great .
2374,"however ,  i can live with it and you become used to it after a bit of time ."
2375,when you use it to interact to the game it orders are understood % of the time .
2376,"i am very ,  very disappointed with this product . july ,  num_extend"
2377,the sounds while coloring are unnecessary and distract from the childhood simplicity of coloring .
2378,so i live with a roommate but cook alone .
2379,my wife was tickled with the way this looked and felt until she tried to fasten it .
2380,i ve had no issues with that in the past .
2381,eventually the water sneaks itself back in the darn goggles .
2382,i have been searching for a zippered pillow case for my body pillow for awhile now .
2383,its the num_extend one to break like that .
2384,this is an awesome grinder short of spending a ton more cash .
2385,make sure that they open back up and provide a good fit in the downspout .
2386,i serve it with brie and crusty baguettes .
2387,"this fit perfectly  it was a low end oster blender ,  $ or so  and the blender works again !  ."
2388,i use the bottom part of the box alone as a regular litter pan .
2389,put the two together and it would be impressive at least .
2390,"i regularly buy wendy s jamocha shake ,  add chocolate to my coffee ,  and like coffee ice cream with chocolate syrup ."
2391,i bought this set num_num months ago and i m very happy with it .
2392,easy to clean and has it s own little stand .
2393,i also use it when cutting the grass .
2394,guess i ll throw these away and go back to maxell . i d sincerely suggest you pass on these .
2395,the color is not that bad but the size kill it for me .
2396,"however ,  i may now be switching my allegiance . the katinkas case is essentially a leather sleeve ."
2397,"the handles are firm ,  not flimsy ,  and i like the shape as they are easy to pour ."
2398,the stainless steel pot and cover clean up easily .
2399,"unfortunately ,  the next time we went back to costco they didn t have any in stock  typical of costco  ."
2400,very disappointed since i actually didnt get the product that is pictured here .
2401,check with the seller how many doubles to expect .
2402,i made some pancakes with the mix and they did not taste right at all .
2403,"basically ,  it all boils down to one thing ."
2404,"buy a zalman !  !  ! i purchased this chill mat ,  and it worked for a short period of time ."
2405,"well made and it works ,  but it s smaller than i expected ."
2406,seem identical tot he ones that came with the machine .
2407,i bought two of these  family of three  and am very happy with them .
2408,i have used this num_num times so far and it has not made any bubbles .
2409,i ve had this coffee grinder for almost num_num years and it s terrific .
2410,"in my case ,  the coffee is above average and it doesn t take much time to brew ."
2411,i use the medium and it is perfect .
2412,"you could purchase num_num band aids for that price ,  use some neosporin and replace them each day ."
2413,i must say i was and still am quite disappointed with this product .
2414,the finish is rough and uneven in many places as if it were applied unevenly .
2415,i didn t know it came with it and didn t realize it was folded up neatly in the packaging .
2416,it is pretty durable so far no problems .
2417,"plus ,  you can always return it to amazon if dissatisfied . got it and now use it daily ."
2418,you ve got to get at least num_num to add to your collection .
2419,i love the grandia series . let me repeat that .
2420,"likewise ,  you have to scroll through your emails one .  .  . line .  .  . at .  .  . a .  .  . time ."
2421,it is made out of poor quality material .
2422,my big complaint and i am surprised that more people have not commented on this .
2423,hard to believe they took this to market !  .
2424,mic placement can be a little tricky at first .
2425,"to mix properly ,  the pan can t be too wide ."
2426,"sadly ,  it was a bit of a disappointment ."
2427,i does not go on easily and you do have to work at it a little .
2428,i have been using my mom s waffle iron for the last num_num years  no exaggeration  .
2429,this makes quick work of slicing things for canning and dehydrating .
2430,"iphone is the best ,  next num_extend and then droid ."
2431,"i purchased this for home ,  i am happy with this product ."
2432,i doubt these will be lasting very long .
2433,they also offer replacement blades for this item .
2434,"either way ,  it still works as well as when i first purchased it ."
2435,would definately recommend this one over the $ version !  it works great for any standard household needs !  .
2436,the coating on the pot is meant for making sauces or slightly thicker stocks .
2437,they are so simple and pretty and go with just about anything .
2438,my dog would not walk in this no matter what we tried .
2439,i never use the locking feature except for storage .

2441,doesn t feel as solid as most other oxo products .
2442,i commend them for standing behind the products they sell !  .
2443,i have had several pressure cookers over many years and this one rates up there with the best .
2444,as far as i can tell it s easier to move to a smaller house than get this thing working .
2445,"they re long ,  they fit well in your hand ,  they grip well and they don t scratch your nonstick cookware ."
2446,i bought these to wear at my desk at work .
2447,i ve played with it and the backing is tight and tough .
2448,it is attached firmly to my dvr and my receiver .
2449,i struck out on my own and bought five styluses and this one works very nicely .
2450,but a trip to walmnart will reveal better options .
2451,"i really like the handle ,  shape and weight of this knife ."
2452,but once it begins to cool it will go back to the blazing scarlet color again .
2453,other reviewers have mentioned the magnet falling off .
2454,this stone is thick and heavy so it holds heat really well and cooks the crust evenly .
2455,this is our num_extend try at nonstick cookware .
2456,they are a good size for dinner plates and i love to mix n match the colors .
2457,i am very pleased with the look and performance of this screen .
2458,when i was told i could have this game i was pumped .

2461,they feel funny in my ear and just always seemed awkward . i like this unit .
2462,"i even placed them on paper towels and waited an hour ,  but still they were damp ."
2463,i fatty batteries already charged in purse for emergency .
2464,"huh ,  probably most reviewers won t agree with me on this one ,  but i found this game extremely boring ."
2465,"this equates to about one dollar a day to operate ,  depending on your electricity cost ."
2466,"then i wash the herbs in the basket ,  and then spin dry ."

2470,"if you have small num_extend burners on your ceramic top range ,  this pot has the footprint to fit ."
2471,the top of the shaker still fits tightly and i use this shaker almost daily .
2472,"i knew oxo made them ,  but could never find them . thanks amazon !  ."
2473,the first being the fisher price laugh and learn house .
2474,i much prefer a magnetic block but these are great for taking knives for travel or on the move .
2475,"it takes less time to process also ,  a good two hours less ."

2477,no more trying to get all the garlic out of the holes .

2480,i have used corelle desert bowls for cat food bowls for years .
2481,"my account recognized it right away ,  and i was talking immediately ."
2482,never had any problems; never falls out my ear .
2483,i am going to try my luck with another brand .
2484,i ve also made my own barbecue sauce in it .
2485,you would probably not have any trouble forgiving the stray blemish .
2486,"i knew this was not a large crock pot ,  but i hadn t realized how small it was ."
2487,"the colors are nice ,  and the styluses are pretty light in weight ."
2488,i have had this cover for about three weeks now .
2489,i put this in my garage for my collection of sun visors .  .  . i am in florida .
2490,if someone asked me to recommend a portable charger it would definitely recommend this .
2491,the shine fades away pretty quickly leaving a nice radiant effect .
2492,the app itself is simple to use and provides basic settings . this grip does exactly what it describes .
2493,"that is the first thing that disappointed me . second ,  the bag is very fragile ."
2494,"maybe i have thick arms for my size ,  i don t know ."
2495,"i wanted this to work ,  but felt no difference ."
2496,"num_extend because they are so light ,  they can slide around the counter ."
2497,"this lodge pan was purchased for my brother ,  but i have the same pan ,  it s just a lot older ."
2498,"if that doesn t burn your eyes ,  the citric acid will ."

2501,"steel is the way to go . i chose two which were quite similar ,  but were different only by shape ."
2502,i have had no problems with this thermometer .
2503,it smells similar to a wet towel shoved into a gym locker for a month .
2504,i trusted the lixit name and i m disappointed .
2505,"hasbro ,  why !  .  .  .  . why do you keep getting it wrong ?  .  .  . this isn t even close ."
2506,a garbage can well worth the price and the num_num starts .

2512,"they oscillate nicely ,  they re very quiet for fans and they move just the right amount of air ."
2513,"lastly ,  there was zero contact info for the supplier ."
2514,i would recommend you look elsewhere for something of higher quality .

2516,"another minor issue ,  lint and dust seems drawn to the silicone areas like a magnet ."
2517,"this pan makes a great pizza ,  i ve used it several times already and very happy with it ."
2518,"as it happened ,  we really needed a new set of knives ."

2562,"to hold the trimmer ,  one must place one s hands over the vacuum air exit slots ,  thus throttling the num_extend"

2564,look elsewhere if that is the main selling point in your household .
2565,it really is not intuitive to use if you want a countdown for a cooking step .
2566,be sure to condition the battery to keep it running smoothly for a long time to come .

2760,but you do give up a lot of the functionality that makes the phone special .
2761,we don t have to heat a big oven for a small amount of food .
2762,but the num_extend cartridges hold no where near as much space as the playstations black cds .
2763,"for those unfamiliar with cast iron ,  you simply dont know what your missing ."
2764,"even if the playing pieces are cheaply made and the money gets worn and crinkled ,  it s an awesome game ."
2765,my wife has been extremely satisfied with this cheese grater .
2766,it has a not unpleasant taste to it but it does not taste like a strawberry milkshake .
2767,i decided to try the shock on me which i should have done in the first place .
2768,i think this game cannot be called a sonic the hedgehog game .
2769,"i gave this a poor review ,  but i realized that i was making an error in installation ."
2770,"just have to make sure there is no sag in your curtain rod ,  or that it is installed uneven ."
2771,"i have metal ones for the grill ,  and this is my indoor set of tongs ."
2772,it s truly worthless and should be banned from being sold on amazon .
2773,"the shipping was fast ,  and price was great ."
2774,"i understand the reason for this ,  but it makes it just a little less useful ."
2775,this timer does everything that it is meant to do .
2776,"on the second use ,  one of the plastic snaps just broke ."
2777,they are very durable and have lasted a long time .
2778,the comments i have received have actually been negative .
2779,it can easily be removed if swapping a sim or battery .
2780,case fits the iphone num_num num_extend good too .
2781,so glad i bought it and will replace it with same in future if need be .
2782,"this products doesn t support any new android phone ,  not num_extend compatible ."
2783,you need gil to get anywhere in this game .
2784,then i ordered the zagg num_extend back up battery system .
2785,"and yeah ,  they re not made for baking .  .  . so they re mainly for storage purposes only ."
2786,"be carefull ,  not all sellers are serious as they seem ."
2787,it sounds like cheap piece of junk but does a good fast job .
2788,"plus ,  you might as well get the cheaper standard vga cable ."
2789,sound was notably degraded from a cd played directly though the denon .
2790,when u get the sims house party you will feel like you are playing the original sims .
2791,i m very disappointed that ea released this game so early with so many bugs .
2792,dyson is a great product but it s certainly not perfect .
2793,you do not need to replace the filter every num_num days .
2794,definitely a good value and buy on this .
2795,i would recommend getting a sample of this before buy .
2796,i purchased this product a month or so after i purchased my phone .
2797,"even the ports are more or less the same ,  the same weight ."
2798,"i bought a medium ,  and it is big enough for a puppy ,  that is it ."
2799,my next purchase will be a lexar card and i hope i wont be dissapointed again .
2800,the missions are extremely unforgiving and hard boring .
2801,"but ,  there is little space on the board for pieces to occupy the same spot ."
2802,i give these an extra star for style ;  thus far they are num_num for num_extend
2803,but that s small cheese when you take this device as a whole .
2804,"usually ,  oilier the coffee beans   starbacks ,  for example more static it has ."
2805,instead of light and translucent it was white and cakey .
2806,i was able to return the product and get a refund .
2807,maybe that had something to do with it arriving in working order and the atn arrived defective .
2808,i have used this pot num_num times before i realized it was flaking in my food .
2809,i have used real high end steak knives $ per knife  and these are not much different .
2810,"of course ,  before the batteries actually die ,  the thing stops working properly ."
2811,when this appeared in the vine we figured we would give it a shot .
2812,used these for a previous wireless phone that one of my granddaughters had at the time .
2813,the gaming repeats num_num or num_num actions all the time without any evolution happening .
2814,i only used mine on planes when traveling so i do not feel as though i abused the unit .
2815,gave this to my daughter for her iphone and she absolutely loved it .
2816,it takes num_num batteries and it is like a game .
2817,"i let mine air dry after washing and they were fine ,  even after several washes ."
2818,provided enough protection for me at the time . like the soft touch material gives a nice sure grip .
2819,the medium num_num cup bowl is good for leftovers and typically goes into the refrigerator .
2820,i got these for a wedding gift num_num years ago .
2821,i shudder to think how quickly my six aa alkaline batteries will be consumed .
2822,"not easy to clean ,  sweats on the bottom ,  cheap fiber ,  no ,  not a good product ."
2823,you don t need much to give the wood a healthy look and feel .
2824,the material is a tough hard material that resembles a basket weave pattern .
2825,"instead ,  it s a cheap funhouse mirror type of mirror .  .  . who wants to look at that ?  ?  ."
2826,"if anyone is interested in buying them don t hesitate ,  they are worth it ."
2827,whats up with the cars driving on the wrong side of the road .
2828,the piece of chew goes down the wrong way and expands .
2829,"after num_num months it quit monitering at all ,  so its now nothing more that a watch ."
2830,"this grinder ,  unlike many others ,  has the proper blade shape ."
2831,it lacked story and that is one of the major reasons why i play videogames .
2832,to my dismay the coffee was pretty weak excpecially when i put it in a num_num oz thermos .
2833,"all in all ,  it s the easiest way to make poached eggs ."
2834,"very simple to use ,  even easier to clean ."
2835,"as far as i m concerned ,  this place is the only place online ."
2836,many curries that i enjoy most are thick and have a tomato paste type texture .
2837,i called customer service to advise them that the item was cracked at the bottom of the large container .
2838,i think it would make my skin too oily .
2839,it definitely should not be labeled a  heater  .
2840,"we have almost every type of corkscrew made ,  from the big ,  bulky houdini to the super simple waiters  model ."
2841,i found that too many kernels go unpopped for my liking .
2842,within a mile i felt something by my feet .
2843,"my two cats  one kitten ,  one adult  have made attempts to use this scratcher ,  but it s simply too unstable ."
2844,most of the time you ll jump off edges by accident .
2845,i ll let you know how that turns out .
2846,"no problem with swiping or drawing ,  but the static tip often feels like it s about to fall off ."
2847,it is a superbly capable piece that will not disappoint the experienced cook . construction and finish are excellent .
2848,i had read reviews about the sizing of this product and thought i should size down instead of up .
2849,"in fact ,  after less than a month of use ,  the thumbs are unravelling ."
2850,products but i definitely wouldnt buy this again .
2851,i bleached my hair twice to get it to a nice pale blonde shade .
2852,in most cases this attachment will eliminate the need for a food processor .
2853,this toy simply does not match the television ad at all .
2854,i wanted to add to my old white set so i chose this in black .
2855,i can t say whether this product gets rid of wrinkles .
2856,i clean out the litterbox twice a day and there s no bad smells that come from it .
2857,i searched for years and did not find any diffusers until in the num_extend
2858,the cats were more interested in the device  it makes a small whirring noise  and none chased the laser .
2859,i would recommend it to a friend  or even a stranger  .
2860,the necrons are so easy to win with its boring .
2861,"when i first bought this ,  the zipper seemed fine ,  but now i know it is a very cheap zipper ."
2862,i ordered some so i can t wait to use it .
2863,"it will work just as well ,  if not better ."
2864,i have a new daily coffee ritual now with this pot andcafe bustelo coffee espresso .
2865,these screen protectors get the job done and for the price can t be beat .
2866,"on my larger pan ,  i use butter ,  not cooking spray ."
2867,only used these clippers two num_extend times before it became unusable  dead  .
2868,not a nice shadeyet definetly great quality  : s .
2869,"it has a nice material on the outside ,  fleece on the inside and some waterproof material between the layers ."
2870,i expected standard size clays because this was offered with a clay target shooter .
2871,i read the ingredients and there was nothing but preservatives and it had egg whites in it .
2872,my sister had accidentally washed our other ice cream scooper .
2873,they do most of the work for you .
2874,i am using a large air pump with it and nothing works .
2875,not to happy and now i got to buy a new bag .
2876,"the color is vivid ,  bright blue ,  so pretty ."
2877,neither were effective and the device is cheaply made and does not turn off unless the battery is removed .
2878,i always keep it in my car plugged in .
2879,there seems to be some confusion over that .
2880,i only dislike that i can charge it up with a regular usb that sucks .
2881,this is very dangerous as cats have been known to break a tooth while playing with metal objects .
2882,these heavy pans then go through an enameling process before being shipped .
2883,i use it at least twice a week .
2884,it is a shame such a nice case has such a basic flaw .
2885,"easy to store ,  wit a protective cover to prevent any accidental cuts or harm from the num_extend"
2886,the micro usb has not been yanked out of the battery yet .
2887,it is unhumane the way they are killed .
2888,you put them in your car s sound system and immediately regret that decision .
2889,"with gr you can move almost anywhere you want ,  and attack targets from any angle ."
2890,"i ve never had those slim boards ,  but now i only want those ."
2891,"first of all ,  none of the music is bemani ,  which means no more cool ddr music ."
2892,the coffee comes out plenty hot and tastes great .
2893,the design is so cute and the size is great .
2894,not a big deal but sometimes mildly irritating .
2895,don t expect angry birds or other animated games to work well .
2896,"one you cut the screws ,  you better hope you didn t cut too short or you can still tread ."
2897,tastes dry unless toasted and unless cream cheese or butter put on .
2898,"this toy is not as entertaining as it could be ,  really ."
2899,amazon should be ambarrased to fulfill this item for the seller .
2900,"when i got a chance to splurge and try it ,  i was sooooo disappointed ."
2901,"if you can get past that though ,  the flavor is alright ."
2902,"this is a great steam vac ,  it s powerful ,  cleans really good and picks up most of the water too ."
2903,"in this day and age ,  must use caution ,  regarding lead ,  etc ."
2904,i ended up resorting back to my trusty spoon and finger technique .
2905,those of us with fur in our lives know that it gets into everything .
2906,"apps start instantaneously ,  internet is speedy and gps locks on in seconds ."
2907,the jawbone is phenomenal but its ear piece is crap .
2908,"my boyfriend even discovered that he could make grilled burritos on this ,  which is something i hadn t thought of ."
2909,i am extremely happy with both the sound quality and the range from base on this set .
2910,fit my rezound which was what i was hoping for .
2911,the bass was really there and the volume was too .
2912,furthermore i couldn t get the string tyed so that you couldn t see the knot .
2913,i ordered this product because my hair tends to be very dry and i sometimes have breakage .
2914,i ve been using it for a week now and i just can t take it anymore .
2915,it appears that i will still be brewing dunkin donuts coffee at home .
2916,i will probably purchase another when i need a new stylus .
2917,store it out of reach of small hands .
2918,my girl friend loves it so much that she never answer her phone without it .
2919,"yesterday i tried soaking it completely submerged for a few hours ,  and that seemed to help a little bit ."
2920,search the internet; it s a common problem after you ve had them for a while .
2921,it also fits in the motorola navigation dock  after insert is taken out  with the case still on .
2922,i am happy with the performance i get .
2923,i did a lot of research before selecting this one .
2924,it seems the design of it is too open to getting the plug outlet wet .
2925,i was hoping this would make it easier for my husband but too much comes out at once .
2926,i am in the process of returning this item .
2927,this product i thought on top of a decent conditioner would be a no brainer .  . no tangles at all .
2928,"this is ok lip balm ,  but nothing special ."
2929,"relatively cheap ,  solid brand ,  perfect size ,  and ease of use . couldnt be more happy ."
2930,if you want it to fit more you have to buy more pieces .
2931,"i m not blind to the benefits of products like these ,  and have been trying some as an experiment ."
2932,my fault :  i didn t check the dimensions before ordering .
2933,it is very thin and not really good if you have a serious wound .
2934,the content itself was also much more difficult and more fun .
2935,the single solitary reason i gave this num_num stars instead of num_num is flying .
2936,i got it last month on one of those friday sales  cheap pricing and free shipping  .
2937,i dropped my phone several times and it was not even scratched .
2938,"when you try to pour out it ,  a large quantity of the liquid ends up on the counter ."
2939,i personally did not like how the case covered the entire phone .
2940,some soy milk it might not work with .
2941,my son gave me these for mother s day .
2942,these will end up in the donation bin .
2943,i expected a good product and that is just what i received .
2944,"yet just like in wintertime wonderland ,  they are wearing skirts ."
2945,an excellent toaster oven at a very attractive price .
2946,or dishes that are for the family to serve from like tacos .
2947,it s gotta be more than the db rating it s published under .
2948,"this mix has a strange taste ,  hard to describe ."
2949,"we managed to useit and repair it  reformat ,  download new drivers for another num_num months ."
2950,with my dvd you have a crude search feature .
2951,you obviously can t really use this affectively on cups .
2952,shes ready to oder anothor one and soon .
2953,"and if i wanted to get a umd like an idiot ,  that d be another $"
2954,even back then it wasn t the best pre workout on the market or even close to it .
2955,"of all the tomcat products ,  this one has to be the worst ."
2956,what am i supposed to do with it between times i use it ?  .
2957,comb glides through effortlessly and does as good if not better than biolage or wen .
2958,the shape and weight of the scoop allows you to scoop even the hardest ice cream .
2959,"if this is the style of case you are looking for ,  you can t get a better case ."
2960,every kitchen should have this and its smaller and larger brothers .
2961,this is an expensive mouse for so little benefit .
2962,i found this toy very lacking and not worth the money .
2963,this set of remarkably durable pyrex storage containers impresses me .
2964,so i end up having to wash up in the end like i never used any gloves at all .
2965,"it doesn t  look  very important ,  but it is ."
2966,the wireless card from netgear for num_extend is pretty strong also .
2967,i am still dealing with the cystic acne .
2968,"you can drink it straight ,  customize it with milk ,  foam ,  and flavors ."
2969,"it s nice to have at my sons ball games ,  when i need to charge my phone ,  ipod ,  etc ."
2970,"they give an extension cable with the unit ,  but it s far too long ."
2971,my only complaint is about the length of the cord .
2972,"the top is air tight ,  though takes a little getting used to how to use it ."
2973,they are great !  the three sizes handle a pint of berries to enough tomatoes for a batch of sauce .
2974,once you use this you will never want to use another .
2975,"this is now my go to pan ,  and i will be ordering more in the very near future ."
2976,unfortunately the inner lining is cheaply made and glued one .
2977,"everything needs to be bigger as you get older ,  and this little time is highly visible ."
2978,my case takes all of num_num seconds to remove .
2979,"the bore cleaning procedure is effective ,  probably about as good as using a proper rod ,  brush and jag ."
2980,you control a women who never speeks on camera but supposidly does off .
2981,"i can t say that this media caused the problem ,  but i replaced it with another brand ."
2982,there was no problem getting another one shipped out .
2983,"i ve been buying new balance shoes from amazon for ages ,  i ve had maybe num_num pairs .  .  .  .  . always in a num_extend num_extend"
2984,but the top piece of this  which comes in a bunch of different pieces  always comes off .
2985,"the clasp on the band has a way of becoming unhooked ,  just at the wrong times ."
2986,pyrex is used to put in oven to bake .
2987,this is great heavy duty pot for a very low price .
2988,some how i managed to lose a lid during hunting season and this is the replacement for the loss .
2989,easy to care for and sharpen on a regular basis .
2990,"i find i need a more firm ,  stable nylon spatula for heavier foods ."
2991,"i have a tablet ,  bluetooth speaker ,  smartphone ,  kindle and num_extend player ."
2992,it is solidly constructed  the handle gets a bit hot  and cooks evenly .
2993,i used to have a regular messaging phone that drained its battery like a smartphone .
2994,"but ,  you could just get a hot air popper and never have to buy the powercup concentrators ."
2995,i am happy with the purchase and would recommend these headphones .
2996,not a good fit at all .  . not even close to it .
2997,"after several years and lots of use ,  the wire had to be replaced for cutting ."
2998,this heavy duty can opener can handle the larger cans with no problem .
2999,"i am glad to hear it works for some ,  but not for me ."
3000,"unfortunately ,  there are only two graphics cards that this game will recognize ."
3001,we have not had any problems with these cases .
3002,i have had lots of gummy bear types of vitamins .
3003,"what if it falls and cracks the counter ?  if you re not careful ,  it rusts ."
3004,necessitates transferring heated contents to another container if you want to enjoy immediately .
3005,keeps the drawer neat and safe from these sharp instruments .
3006,these burner covers look great on my black gas stove .
3007,wanted a new look for my cakes and love roses so went with this .
3008,"it still vibrates though ,  and i can hear the sound fluctuation with the vibration and it can be annoying ."
3009,they all entail opening up the roomba and cleaning out the sensor directly .
3010,"in addition ,  this charger has num_extend output and is genuine motorola oem of the finest quality ."
3011,"it was hard to give this software stars ,  since the game itself is a great simulation ."
3012,it does nothing to cover up the smell of the cat s urine or fecal matter .
3013,look great in the room and he says they are very comfortable .
3014,"i know the difference between yellow jackets ,  honey bees ,  bumble bees ,  paper wasps ,  and bald faced hornets ."
3015,my cats won t eat this unless i sprinkle nutritional yeast on it or mix it with other food .
3016,i ve had a corded logitech trackball for num_num years i think .
3017,"for a game that purports to have quick battles ,  bosses have way too much hp ."
3018,it would not register the tire pressure accurately .
3019,"volume ?  where ?  it did nothing to thicken the appearance of my lashes ,  despite its spackle consistency ."
3020,"i suspect the reasoning is because of the cord ,  which i complained about earlier ."
3021,it truly does pull food and heavy mixtures into the blades better than competing designs .
3022,"this is bigger picture ,  and i honestly think it takes most of the fun away from the old one ."
3023,the handle finally fell off my favorite cheese plane after years of use .
3024,it doesn t take up too much room on my counter either .
3025,you ll need the hotterbreville num_extend electric gourmet wok .
3026,the red indicator on the receiver flashed  nice feature  but no action was taken on the pc .
3027,the lid is also easy to put on .
3028,"the cord fits very snug ,  i doubt it would just slip out ."
3029,"they arrived with other items ,  in a bigger package ,  and the package was not damaged ."
3030,now it doesn t work on your dashboard if its got any grooves in it .
3031,they browned up beautifully and all i had to do was wipe them off with a paper towel .
3032,"i don t know if i just got a bad one ,  but this toy was so dang flimsy ."
3033,"i do enjoy salads ,  but i don t enjoy all the prep work cleaning the greens for the salads ."
3034,"conveniently ,  when i came home ,  my expensive espresso maker broke ."
3035,easy to return however so as always .  .  .  . love my amazon  :   .
3036,i most certainly would not recommend this product .
3037,i own another set of circle cutters from foxrun and they don t even compare to these ateco cutters .
3038,been using it on most of my meats and then marinading them overnight .
3039,i bought this board along with a wusthof knife set .
3040,so i added num_num tb water and then the batter looked good .
3041,"the charging methods provided were exceptional ,  and the charging case is just plain cool ."
3042,the one drawback is that this headset is on the large side .
3043,it does not hold as well as my medium hold spray .
3044,i have this mounted in an num_extend suburban .
3045,this game is boring and the game play is so bad it s not worth playing .
3046,"it s not a horrible game ,  but it s just not as good as its predecessors or its successors ."
3047,don t try to use the poach egged methods .
3048,don t buy this item if you are looking to clean a dvd or cd drive on your computer .
3049,you can find much more expensive products out there  stainless steel  but they are so much more expensive .
3050,i will say the company s packaging and delivery was very good .
3051,the points are short and you do have to use some common sense when using it .
3052,"take the leap ,  try them out ,  and enjoy how easily your curtain moves along ."
3053,"it feels really heavy on my fingers ,  too ."
3054,i use the tongs mostly for lasagna noodles and they are the best i ve had for that .
3055,maybe it has something to do with the meat being a product of brazil vs .
3056,this is upsetting because i wanted to recharge the speaker at work and could not .
3057,i didn t really want to spend $ for an otterbox .
3058,these cake boards are well made and strong .
3059,she says she still feels the same after taking these pills for over a month .
3060,the handle is a great design for versatility and larger hands because it is open at the bottom .
3061,this is a true quality piece of kitchen equipment .
3062,"however ,  within num_num hours ,  she ripped off num_num of the num_num legs ."
3063,many times my laptop won t even detect a signal .
3064,but this is not what it is advertised for .
3065,i let the grandkids each pick out an inflatable pool toy and one chose this one .
3066,i do not know why it was included in the game .
3067,the zippers are totally flimsy and cheap on the flexi brand compared to outward num_extend
3068,it can filter a cup of water in about num_num seconds .
3069,to bad it makes my phone thinker and heavier .
3070,unsafe and disappointed as it came off her .
3071,and i give them one star for trying . the game really does look good .
3072,"sorry ,  cuisinart ,  we expect performance and durability from you ."
3073,never before have i received compliments on a phone case .
3074,i purchased this to add an extension phone line into my bedroom .
3075,but it charges my ipod touch even while im playing it .
3076,i was disappointed in it the moment she opened it and it was turned on .
3077,"stay away from this boring ,  and so highly overated game ."
3078,"whereas ,  this bag has two very thin pockets that bulge very easily ."
3079,this item was shipped quickly and arrived within a day or two .
3080,the flavor was barely detectable so we tried adding more drops .
3081,"i didn t need it ,  but with tools ,  it s always nice to have extra ."
3082,many reviewers have commented that this cuisinart isn t the same quality as the old ones .
3083,i bought these and good sense and find these are bitter and not enjoyable .
3084,the other dog didn t have diarahea but had loose stools .
3085,they would be easier to find if they were neon green or neon orange !  guess i better order more .
3086,i use this timer for many little tasks around the house when time is a factor .
3087,have found it tips easy when using slicer when you push down on it .
3088,"rendered meat can be any rendered mammal meat ,  including cats and dogs ."
3089,someone meant well buying these and my son truly loves them .
3090,the case is right but the color is off .
3091,perhaps the blaster is better as a preventative .
3092,"however ,  i would not repurchase because i have not noticed a change in my dog s coat at all ."
3093,well got some other great games from them and am happy as hell .
3094,"i really wanted to like this ,  but i don t ."
3095,"then ,  he grabbed a glass of water and chugged it to get the taste out of his mouth ."
3096,this press is very easy to use and in no time i have coffeehouse quality coffee .
3097,"the level design is pretty bad ,  everything is scripted and feels like a shooting gallery ."
3098,bought a lot of knife sharpener and this is awesome .
3099,"i have tried others ,  like this oil the best ."

3340,he loves putting the balls in it and loves pulling it around .
3341,these are durable and reliable as is most pyrexware .

3364,how can you go wrong with a fondue this one is great and is being used all the time .

3529,voice command with this headset and the num_extend works exactly as it should .

3569,stop believing all the hype in the magazines and on the commercials .

3582,the anti glare ones i think are a little better .
3583,"honestly ,  i could mix up a better solution myself ."
3584,this case is protective but allows me to slip it in my pocket .
3585,these are as hard to see as what was on there and more pain than they are worth .
3586,almost everything in my kitchen is now glass .
3587,"stainless top takes some maintenance ,  and will show scratches ,  but that s not unexpected ."

3593,i was surprised by how quiet it was after reading reviews .
3594,great for storage and easy open and close .
3595,"and for that usage ,  i think it s perfect ."

3609,"with noise cancellation on ,  the sound is even worse ."
3610,i honestly almost passed this presto powerpop gadget up .
3611,i m sure it will be around for years to come .
3612,the case always unsnaps itself randomly for no good reason .
3613,i can honestly say that there is simply no comparison .
3614,"if you put your device down and turn away from it with these on ,  the sound will cut out ."
3615,"my package arrived ,  i opened it and realized there was no dropper included ."
3616,this is not a  sports chew  or healthy snack .

3782,they both work great . i like this one particularly for burgers cooked in a round pan .
3783,i m sorry i wasted my money buying it .
3784,i got mine at bed bath and beyond but have since bought one for my mom and sister .
3785,"adding stars to the chart is a chore ,  and needs a star ."
3786,"in no time at all ,  i have a perfect temperature cup of tea ."
3787,"this is the deepest lasagna pan i have been able to find ,  and that is why i bought it ."
3788,it can be a very frustrating experience . the case also looks ugly and feels cheap .
3789,"in a previous review ,  an enamored me called namco  the next squaresoft  ."
3790,"after i restored it ,  i tried to play music and one of the speakers doesn t work ."
3791,it came in and was just as advertised .
3792,this litter box was also featured on the show  my cat from hell  season num_num ep .
3793,"i added a can to the fuel tank ,  and half a can each to the crankcase and air intake ."
3794,"i ve come to rely on their switches ,  hubs and nics for my home network ."
3795,"since it was in a room with num_num or so computers ,  the noise didn t really bother me that much ."
3796,bought those at least num_num years ago and they still work .
3797,i have not noticed any shortening of battery life throughout the time i ve owned this .
3798,"absolutely great when you are cooking ,  so you do not need to waste paper towels or clean wash cloths ."
3799,"what this game simulates ,  however ,  i have no idea ?  this game .  .  . is   .  .  .   !  ."
3800,"they are not made for this ,  they are storage caps and they are wonderful when used as storage caps ."
3801,the measuring marks are embedded so i don t think they will wear off easily over time .
3802,"before you buy this ,  measure out num_num oz because it was way smaller than i thought it would be ."
3803,"what s the aristocrat club ?  i have no idea ,  but it s just there ."
3804,no non stick coating which i am trying to eliminate .
3805,buy the uag and save yourself the headache .
3806,i have had two of these medline reachers .
3807,alright let me sum this up for you .
3808,"the timbales are sturdy and really a good buy ,  in my opinion ."
3809,"the results did not continue ,  and i m back to the flatness of before ."
3810,"although i like the adjustability ,  this cage lasted less than six months ."
3811,this router works for one or two days and then drops its connection .
3812,the plastic lids fit snuggly .  .  . perhaps a little too snug as removal takes more effort than most .
3813,"unfortunately ,  these high jump and long jump options only seem to work when they feel like it ."
3814,the only saving grace is that it wears off quickly .
3815,it contains num_num grams of protein but only % calcium and % iron for the rda .
3816,i already owned the saucepan that goes underneath the steamer .
3817,one for my wife and myself . i highly recomend this unit !  ! go get it ! joel .
3818,she uses them with all her blue tooth things .
3819,this is a piece of junk don t buy .
3820,but the problem with this one was the voice recognition was very weak .
3821,this new pan is slick enough to let me slide eggs out of the pan with a tilt .
3822,i can t see this thing surviving very long .
3823,my concern with the purchase of the evo num_extend was battery life .
3824,i farm num_extend acres in iowa and am in and out of noisy tractors regularly .
3825,twix especially looking more sick than ever . there s just no way possible i could recommend this product .
3826,the red light is on all other times when the grill is plugged in . cleaning it is easy enough .
3827,i couldn t be more pleased with this product .
3828,"however ,  i did not buy it particularly for the vacuum capabilities ."
3829,"after a month there were a few long lashes ,  completely uneven ."
3830,miracle whip is still holding the crown in my house .
3831,this is a great funnel and strainer combo .
3832,i had to scrap it and get another one .
3833,"i was a bit confused at the water filler at first ,  but quickly figured it out ."
3834,i was having a problem with a groundhog that was loving some of my cabbage plants to death  literally  .
3835,best coffee grinder i ve had  and i ve gone through about num_extend
3836,we are trying to use more glass dishes in our home instead of plastic .
3837,this was shipped via ups and when i opened the box everything was as it should be .
3838,the color did not look anything like the picture .
3839,i did manage to get the case dirty with maple syrup and saw dust .
3840,cooking veggies makes them easier to eat but will destroy important nutrients .
3841,have to cut it with scissors and still doesn t really fit .
3842,some have complained that they have to run it under water to loosen the pops .
3843,this vacuum can handle being run hard and still works great .
3844,the flap covering the charging port swings open for connecting your apple charging cord .
3845,"the slicer did cut the onion just fine ,  and quickly ."
3846,i like the rubber like side walls of the case which may provide some cushion when i drop it .
3847,"i bought two of these ,  one for the beach house ,  and one for home ."
3848,the port was completed less than num_num hours later .
3849,"if you like the silicone ,  this is a good buy ."
3850,i did not receive an answer . it s now april and version num_num is nowhere to be seen .
3851,a bit shocked by the lack of quality here .
3852,"i had this pot for about two months ,  using it once a week ,  when one handle ,  then another ,  cracked ."
3853,i requested a return and amazon just refunded my money and said to keep it .
3854,this is a real nice case at a good price but to me it is just too slippery .
3855,i didn t expect the big one to fit in my oven .
3856,i thought it just made my coffee taste like paper .
3857,the seasoning of the wok was easy also .
3858,this thing is now just a blue brick in the corner of my room .
3859,they won t get the animal protein they need from a diet like this .
3860,"until this year ,  these chocolates were the best ."
3861,"as i said in my previous review ,  i have both coarse and extra coarse in this brand ."
3862,"this was reasonable price ,  variety of colors ,  came promptly ,  held ice ,  etc ."
3863,i ve used a remote control unit before that was recommended by a trainer .
3864,after receiving these i went back to double check the product description and pictures .
3865,they make a nice base to sit cakes or cheesecakes on .
3866,it gives me peace of mind in case i get stuck away from the house !  .
3867,"the light is bright ,  but it fails for what i needed it for ."
3868,very simple once you know how it works .
3869,fits perfectly and color is still the way it was when i bought it .
3870,it is reported to operate over a longer range than many other routers .
3871,i freeze it  cantaloupe pulp is great too  and have pineapple sorbet .
3872,it works great . the cable i received from sf planet was slightly different from the picture .
3873,"i use organic cane sugar ,  add a few vanilla pods and leave it for a few weeks ."
3874,"our dog is an american eskimo and we live in miami ,  florida ."
3875,"the build quality is fantastic ,  it s heavier than it looks like it should be ."
3876,please review side effects of this product and use with caution .
3877,can t understand how they can get away with calling this natural .
3878,my num_num and num_num year old thought thay made a great treat but i would never consider this nutrition .
3879,cover most things with foil until the end to prevent top burning .
3880,primarily this iphone case is to stop your phone getting scratches .
3881,"i guess if you can ,  buy your cds in person ?  ."
3882,"this stuff is orangy ,  sticky ,  and it stinks really bad .  . hate it ."
3883,work just like the stock batteries and the charger it comes with is great .
3884,"they do the job ,  just not quite as well ."
3885,"even though it says pomeranians could fit xxs ,  i decided to go up a size just in case ."
3886,it s probably me but i couldn t get it to work .
3887,"i hate this case ,  i would like to send it back and get my money back ."
3888,purchased this product when i purchased an axe .
3889,that s true but i have no problem pushing the buttons with it being sealed closed .
3890,thought he d like the squeak noise which he did .
3891,i recommend this and can t wait to try a turkey in it .
3892,"buy them ,  but no one i know has had a pair last longer than a year with light use ."
3893,i haven t had anyone tell me that they couldn t hear me so num_extend
3894,these are excelent styluses plus a good value for your dollar .
3895,these sprayers are low quality and sadly i have like num_num of them .
3896,"i changed bait for num_num more weeks ,  nothing ."
3897,that is the only reason i decided on this pencil .
3898,the missions don t have any real purpose until you beat the game and acually think about what you ve done .
3899,"for those of you who don t know ,  debug codes allows you to have complete control over a game ."
3900,"great ,  i didn t realize it came with cables also ,  thanks ."
3901,we love it !  i like that the blender is detatchable for cleaning and the chopper does an amazing job .
3902,"a quick release means push the clasp n the collar falls off ,  this is not it ."
3903,"my husband liked it when he first got it ,  however it wasn t long before the watch band broke ."
3904,on the first try the outdoor speaker played for num_num seconds then stopped working .
3905,definitely something you would hide in your linen closet  .
3906,"first of all ,  i would like to say that i am very pleased with the vendor ."
3907,"look elsewhere for dark chocolate chunk cookies though .  .  . unless you like dark ,  crumby hard ones ."
3908,"either way though ,  i will not bother trying it again ."
3909,others note how with use a static charge will build and hair will cling .
3910,this arrived on the num_extend and i started using it the last week of feb .
3911,what is good about the cyclop ?  made in france .
3912,"the foam soccer balls are great for cats ,  but these are too hard and don t bounce on carpet ."
3913,"it s sturdy ,  ergonomic ,  well balanced ,  takes a good edge ,  and is very attractive ."
3914,this was only the touch screen and not the rear lcd screen .
3915,"i would highly recommend this system ,  and the bags ,  all available from amazon ."
3916,amazon s corelle designs were more to my liking .
3917,"if they were at my local grocery ,  i might give twenty to thirty cents per can for them ."
3918,was unusable for me on my toshiba laptop .
3919,"at least ,  that s my guess as to why there are such differing opinions on this product ."
3920,i ve owned just about every brand electric razor on the market .
3921,these seem to fluff and fall apart easily .
3922,that didn t last more than a week or so until i again hit the  no lift  issue .
3923,"potatoes should be very crisp ,  they ll cut easier ."
3924,"and guess what ?  it also smells like nail polish ,  is applied like nail polish ,  and dries like nail polish ."
3925,i have owned these headphones for num_num years under limited use .
3926,"they re almost pinkish ,  and don t look like amethysts at all . blue topaz :  too light ."
3927,this is the most versatile pot i own .
3928,"i tried them on several phones and tablets ,  and got the same results . they are comfortable ."
3929,the thing bleeds out in about num_num minutes .
3930,"my hair was natural ,  no dye or anything ."
3931,they gave me headaches and made my hands shaky .
3932,"my tank was never clean for more than a day ,  and i did everything to fix it ."
3933,also complaints of connection speeds being way slow unless you upgrade firmware .
3934,it does not provide any protection but it is a conversation piece .
3935,"i m giving up !  i tried this mix exactly as instructed ,  and it never rose ."
3936,"it is rubbery ,  extremely salty  over half a gram per stick  ,  and has an off taste ."
3937,"my friends ,  this is one of the best purchases i have ever made ,  period ."
3938,would prefer made in the usa where there are better agricultural laws .
3939,i am compelled to say that this line of clarks is just poorly made .
3940,"i was looking forward to this product because of all the good reviews ,  but it was disappointing ."
3941,it is exactly as described and works very well all the time .
3942,"i was just at home doing regular stuff like opening the mail ,  checking email ,  etc ."
3943,the handle has a great weight and the spatula is a great size .
3944,the whistle is a loud low hum that i ve come to prefer over more shrill traditional whistles .
3945,save your $ good backscratcher comes bagged or boxed because it touches your skin .
3946,these go on very nicely and they help protect my phone screen from scratches .
3947,this works fine for me and has not failed yet .
3948,heck i used to make great waffles when i was a kid .
3949,my only two complaints are that you can see the plug spark when you unplug it .
3950,"if i catch the head pain early ,  a couple of snorts of sinus buster takes the pain away completely !  ."
3951,i wanted a good and effective fixed adjustable stand .
3952,that s why it gets the two stars i gave it .
3953,there is no mouse pointer on the screen at all .
3954,the only problem with it is that it faded pretty quickly .
3955,this is a quality product that was designed and manufactured by some smart people .
3956,"it never overheats the coffee ,  never burns it ."
3957,made to sit in a window and survive the occasional rain storm .
3958,"nothing sticks to it !  when it says nonstick it actually means it ,  unlike other pans i have purchased ."
3959,i get lots of compliments when people come over  they haven t seen one so large and functional  .
3960,this sharpener is easy to use and gives pro results in seconds .
3961,here are my problems with the num_extend and why i decided to get the num_extend
3962,i really like cinnamon but it reminded me of the cinnamon toothpicks we made when i was a kid .
3963,my droidx has indicated this device is trying to access my phone book .
3964,mattel has a tiny warning on the box :   not for use with some hot wheels vehicles  .
3965,i feel like it is a well protected case to keep my iphone num_extend from getting broken .
3966,any flaws would be quite noticeable . i previously used krk num_extend so i can compare these to them .
3967,they slice through slippery veggies and tough items as easily as a warm knife through butter .
3968,"because of what i consider to be a significant flaw ,  this is a somewhat superficial review of armored num_extend"
3969,i was excited to recieve this from the amazon vine program .
3970,"but otherwise ,  i haven t had any problems with it after a year ."
3971,the boxes are just too short for big cats .
3972,also tried it on the wife and kids and works on them too .
3973,a push of the button will light up the level of charge .
3974,however i suspect i will buy the num_extend lid sooner or later .
3975,i love the second panasonic !  !  i m glad i stayed with it .
3976,i would never recommend this product for the following num_extend not made in us .
3977,"then at final praise ,  comes the dualing action the game offers which happens at scripted times of the game ."
3978,the covering on the seat should be made of a more durable material .
3979,this is the second replacement blade we ve gotten for our trusty old blender .
3980,we haven t found them to be any more fragile then your average wine glass .
3981,now my pies turn out perfect and nicely brown .
3982,do make sure you wash thoroughly in between uses .
3983,voice recognition :  the voice recognition on the num_extend earpiece is terrible .
3984,"never realized how much  , ilk it takes to make cheese !  !  delicious ! highly recommend !  ."
3985,all the hulls float to the top where i can easily get rid of them .
3986,i have used my ronco dehydrator for quite some time now .
3987,"for one thing ,  this makes the phone a super alarm clock for me without the need for a dock ."
3988,i didnt get what i was expecting to come .
3989,the biggest issue is that the phone still drains power like crazy when in standby mode .
3990,"she lives alone and doesn t need a num_num pound loaf of bread ,  so this looked perfect ."
3991,the product is good quality and came packaged appropriately .
3992,we gave it to my father for christmas .
3993,i am always being asked to bring goodies to work .
3994,"overall ,  if you want a nice thick sturdy case that isn t too bulky ,  this is a great choice ."
3995,asian ladybugs also eat the larvae of native ladybugs .
3996,"it s attractive ,  doesn t take up too much counter space and holds all eight knives that we bought them ."
3997,"here ,  you just feel as if you re not involved enough ."
3998,"good for a commute to work on public transportation ,  except for the ghastly blinking light ."
3999,"instead ,  it lists all the features and expects you to put num_num and num_num together ."
4000,"as the first game on my new num_extend system ,  i prepared myself to be wowed by num_extend"
4001,the pot is just too heavy to lift by that thin handle .
4002,they tasted like old bacon . don t waste your money on these .
4003,"it s on par ,  or maybe slightly better ,  than the standard earphones that come with ipod and iphone ."
4004,i paid num_extend for this and i feel like it was really over priced .
4005,i have had several humidifiers over the years .
4006,so far so good and looking forwarding to another num_num years of usage .
4007,that is a major design flaw in my book so be aware .
4008,instead the programmers decided to have the characters constantly  chew gum  while the voice track is played .
4009,"it came in the flat case ,  and that case is broken ."
4010,bought this to replace the original cable to charge a samsung phone .
4011,these tongs are great for flipping potatoes or other smaller things in a frying pan .
4012,now i am using it as i personally would normally use my device .
4013,wall running consists of you having to be in a dash while running at a wall .
4014,i m a flight attendant and i ve used it already in foreign countries .
4015,haven t used it yet but i can tell it is made very well and has a great handle .
4016,i was happy with this blender until the blade spindle snapped off the motor .
4017,my bodyweight was basically reacting the same as it did before i took these .
4018,"i will ,  however ,  state that bloodlines is a far better game than this ."
4019,i love the way it looks when my coffee is sitting there ready to go .
4020,what a waste of money !  !  !  the only thing the nu bra cover for me was my breast nipples .
4021,these are great casual water or soda glasses that can be used inside or outdoors .
4022,the missions rely on an endless supply of respawning enemy .
4023,as i m writing this the price is about $ which is way high .
4024,the other device worked on the principal of affecting a nerve which kept the sinuses open .
4025,we have a golden retriever so lots of dog fur hits the rug .
4026,"according to that reviewer ,  the quality of this new version is inferior to the old one ."
4027,they have drawn blood on one too many occasions .
4028,just to cook a waffle that is soft .
4029,the cheap price isn t always the best answer .
4030,"it s a shame ,  really ,  as i enjoy bob s red mill products a lot !  ."
4031,i am very surprised and disappointed that this fiber has such high ratings .
4032,"convenient shape and good quality ,  that s about all there is to these measures ."
4033,perfect fit for my num_num by num_num space inside twelve inch cabinets on either side of the stove .
4034,i grabbed the pot from the coffee maker and took a deep breath .
4035,and cleaning the glass jar is so much easier also .
4036,this stuff is supposed to be mixed with water or juice .
4037,charging to full from empty takes between num_num and num_num hours depending on the power of the source .
4038,"it s made in the usa ,  relatively inexpensive ,  easy to use and easy to care for ."
4039,i gave this product two weeks and didn t have the expected results that i ve had with other products .
4040,"one of life s heat bargains ,  and the last of american companies that make the . lodge ,  i salute you !  ."
4041,i bought this based on all of the positive reviews .
4042,also a piece of the plastic broke off .
4043,i d like to find these in larger sizes too .
4044,i m not even sure if a hardcore batfan would even enjoy it .
4045,"to your advantage ,  some rather odd shots go in most of the time ."
4046,it s definitely my fault that i do not have a double boiler .
4047,"great product ,  can t beat the price !  great for everyday uses ,  like grilled cheese !  ."
4048,"ok ,  so my main complaint on this knife is ,  it is seriously the smallest knife known to man ."
4049,their responses are random and unhelpful . this card will go back within the next couple of days .
4050,"i ve had mine for a year now ,  and it was used when i got it ."
4051,hard to get on and off over socks .
4052,i put two bags of ice and lots of drinks in the cooler the day we got it .
4053,"if you re reading this ,  chances are you ve already researched this phone a bit and you ve probably read other reviews ."
4054,"i should have returned them ,  but decided just to suck it up ."
4055,"each time i attempted to open a can ,  the can opener failed to pierce the lid ."
4056,"customer service is voice mail or email ,  never got a response ."
4057,works very well to grind coffee anyway you want it .
4058,the seed just gets stuck and you have to empty it by unscrewing it .
4059,"ive been skating for num_num years and i have always skated nmb bearings ,  no fuss ,  just go ."
4060,i always wanted a glass cake plate to display my baked goods and figured i would look to amazon .
4061,"if i sniff the air ,  i see num_num other routers ."
4062,i ordered thsi for my virgin mobile samsung intercept and have no complaints .
4063,the plastic handles started cracking so i returned it to amazon and got a refund .
4064,the only thing good about this product is that its cheap and it has a cover .
4065,kid just not in to this game very much .
4066,i was careful to balance the clothes on either side and started in the center .
4067,love this for taming the clutter under the bathroom or kitchen sink .
4068,over time this will save money for the plastic wrap i normally buy .
4069,"i could not do it ,  but was good white it lasted ."
4070,it comes down to this being the same old stuff in different packaging .
4071,did expect it to be a little more robust coming from otter box .
4072,i ran the temp from num_extend to num_extend then plotted the data in excel .
4073,a second one would not even turn on after inserting the batteries .
4074,the taste was chalky and it gave me really bad diarrhea .
4075,i m paying that amount only to have something to tide me over until i can buy something better .
4076,the yogurt maker will save you money if you buy lots of organic yogurt !  .
4077,"everyone s skin is different ,  so maybe someone would love this whereas i was unable to ."
4078,front cover goes up to screen bottom and only the home button is exposed .
4079,"so ,  saturday won t stay closed . i threw it away in disgust before ever using it ."
4080,the scent is barely detectable unless you have the machine right under your nose .
4081,it will last for years and never go out of style .
4082,"fits snug ,  small ,  low profile and looks very nice ."
4083,i ve had this coffeemaker for several months now and i ve really come to dislike it .
4084,also zoomed out all the way the clarity was terrible .
4085,i knew it would get roughed up so i installed the lifeproof case .
4086,it took almost two weeks to receive item .
4087,i tried this for a long time after i had my baby .
4088,a drop of essential oil is num_num times stronger than a pinch of the herb plant .
4089,we gave this as a housewarming gift to our nephew and his new bride .
4090,i would ve given it num_num if i could have .
4091,i debated with myself over how to rate this .
4092,"after carefully browsing through user reviews and such ,  we decided to go with this unit ."
4093,there are no highs all mids not impressive at all .
4094,within the hour i was writhing in pain and couldn t imagine what it was . this pain is severe .
4095,oops !  my first one hasn t worn out yet .
4096,call quality is very high and headset is comfortable over prolonged wearing periods .
4097,the rest of the drink went down the sink drain .  .  .  . it was definitely not my cup of  tea  .
4098,their products are much better suited for my needs .
4099,"regardless ,  this knife is so sharp ,  it s unbelievable ."
4100,"the one thing i cannot stand is that at higher temperatures in my oven ,  the pans warp ."
4101,"buy a cat dancer instead ,  it s tried and true ,  and cheap !  ."
4102,lots of people and easier leveling make it very entertaining .
4103,"the one i bought last year ,  terrible .  .  . not stable ,  doesn t sit flat ."
4104,soooooo easy to have perfect hard  boiled  or soft cooked eggs or poached eggs .
4105,i usually pour a cup to drink and the rest stays hot in a thermos .
4106,"an artifact has been stolen from the temple of the num_num dragons ,  and drake s master has been killed ."
4107,"i was hoping this would make my razor glide a bit better ,  and it definitely didn t help with that ."
4108,i purchased this because i had noticed a markedly decreased battery life with my original samsung battery .
4109,the product showed up when it was supposed to .
4110,there are only num_num of us so this is a great size with some left over . very sturdy .
4111,just a great piece of equipment to own if you have an iphone .
4112,"in other words ,  they would not admit that the formula is changed ."
4113,the case does not make the phone bulky .
4114,this would be the same as the other connect num_extend with num_num ways to play .
4115,"it does not ,  however ,  keep my coffee hot for an hour ."
4116,"don t substitute olive or other edible oils ,  as they will go rancid ."
4117,"i have probably used it over num_num times ,  and every time has been wonderful ."
4118,"is there anything as decadent as belgian waffles when you re camping ?   in a trailer ,  of course  ."
4119,i bought this about num_num months ago and have used it quite heavily in that time .
4120,the filter itself is a piece of work to clean .
4121,i recieved these for a gift several years ago and use them every day .
4122,i have an htc incredible and a usb battery  solbat ii  that have micro usb charge ports .
4123,"i ve only had this a few weeks ,  and i ve already got a hole in the mesh bag ."
4124,big box retailers like kohls and walmart only carried small pressure cookers .
4125,gave this a try and found that it works .
4126,these units should work and should provide a good picture brand new .
4127,"whenever i go over there to get stuff ,  i get the irritation ."
4128,"when i rated my product for feedback ,  i let the company who sent it out know ."
4129,i had to take both units apart and shake all of the access cardboard out .
4130,one of the features i like the most is the handle on the side of the cooker .
4131,i bought this as a christmas present for my husband .
4132,smell like burning rubber and are just plain ugly .
4133,it s a phone that seems like its whole goal is middle of the road mediocrity .
4134,"the base is round ,  about num_num inches across ."
4135,it makes cooking super fast and food comes out delicious .
4136,even for jogging these would not be comfy .
4137,"i can keep my flour ,  sugars and many pantry items fresh for a very long time ."
4138,many other games run much faster while displaying many more polygons .
4139,everyone else s talents were wasted by the material they had to work with .
4140,"very well made ,  just as you would expect from a product at this price point from a german company . recommended !  !  ."
4141,"the graphics are horrid ,  both in the cutscenes and in the game ."
4142,"but ,  this case has its flaws which forced me to return it as soon as i received it ."
4143,i learned my lesson .  .  .  .  . look at the ingredients first .
4144,i would not doubt that something hit it .
4145,"maybe i got a lemon ,  but this trimmer was a total disappointment ."
4146,the cat done more of the work though .
4147,also doesn t scratch easy or collect lots of lint and fuzz .
4148,inside a bedroom ?  you will need to find creative ways of dealing with the blue light .
4149,make sure you use the microfiber to clean the surface well .
4150,you just never know until you get a few years into it .
4151,there does not appear to be a full time programer on staff who sends out updates to registered users .
4152,"being able to zoom in in combat is cool ,  but it also limits how far you can seen ."
4153,"anyway ,  i have had no issues with this . as for them being super flexible so you can funnel food .  .  . that s debatable ."
4154,usually i get a good bang for my buck with them .
4155,"it s small ,  realy easy to find a place to store it when not in use ."
4156,freeze ice cream after making it unless you prefer soft num_extend
4157,the recipient was delighted with this tool  along with some others  as she serves spaghetti often .
4158,"it was fresh and buttery ,  but there was no sweet flavor or even any graham flavor ."
4159,it did not even last num_num hour with my son and i before it was completely unusable .
4160,the spacing and spacing adjustments between the barrels are awkward .
4161,"after light use ,  the plastic became so brittle it snapped the handle right off ."
4162,this tool kit was great for my beginning .
4163,"i hate plastic ,  so this was a great alternative ."
4164,i wouldn t say muscle milk powder is intolerable from a taste standpoint .
4165,the controller is shaped like the handlebars on an actual bike .
4166,at first i used it without conditioner and my hair ended up really dry and full .
4167,"unfortunately ,  the design was apparently sold to the current manufacturer some years ago ."
4168,the most important thing to me was that the sound quality be good for music play .
4169,"i realize that any product can have a lemon ,  but num_num out of num_extend"
4170,taking it apart is crazy hard and hurts the hell out of your fingers .
4171,"also ,  the case has helped to guard from water splashing near the device ."
4172,"i use these alot ,  love the locking feature ."
4173,"also ,  they make returns a pleasant experience by providing a return shipping label ."
4174,i use a little mazzola extra virgin olive oil spray .
4175,i would purchase again and would recommend for anyone needing plain white mini cups .
4176,purchased a pair with wooden handles and found the steel in those to be much more of a challenge .
4177,neither have seen much dishwasher action and neither has ever had metal tools used on them .
4178,the thermostat in the base detects the temperature spike that happens when the water has boiled off .
4179,also i found them to be very dry .
4180,i ve been buying these same pants for years .
4181,not a single scratch . when gorilla glass is used you do not need a protector anymore save your money .
4182,it is so slim and fits conveniently into the refrigerator .
4183,i saw this on sale and decided to pick it up and have been very impressed with it .
4184,i have been cooking for num_num years and can remember having at least num_num previous food processors .
4185,i dropped one into my sink and it didn t crack .
4186,"the more simple ,  the less things can go wrong ."
4187,he doesn t play with it because he doesn t want to wind it back up himself .
4188,"the brass parts were tattling around loose in a box with the press part ,  some brass pieces are dented ."
4189,i ve used it maybe a dozen times without a problem .
4190,but power comes at the price of noise level .
4191,better to go for the max temp protection .
4192,i have been using it for cookies and donuts and it serves that purpose quite well .
4193,the duracell is good for an extra num_num hours of talk time .
4194,this unit uses up the batteries even when it is off .
4195,i always have to put in num_num tea bags to get the flavor and benefits i am looking for .
4196,gave each of our kids one as a christmas gift .
4197,spend one minute looking at the carafe before brewing .
4198,my old bags have a metal frame at the top which gives out after a couple years .
4199,they pretty well play anything we through at them .
4200,i barely notice it s there . the only thing that didn t really work to expectation was the power led light .
4201,"the spout even has a small filter in it ,  to remove impurities from your water ."
4202,if you hang num_num towels by the shower you would have replaced the function of this thing .
4203,"it has no slip whatsoever ,  so it s thick and goopey and doesn t spread easily at all ."
4204,i had to wrap a rubber band around the case in order to keep it attached to the phone .
4205,we have three blade safes for our victorinox knives .
4206,i am not crazy about this item at all .
4207,"it s so aggravating i quit using it ,  and am looking for a different model ."
4208,"the photos belied it ,  dressing it up to look like an exquisite piece of work ."
4209,motor didn t hold up on num_num and the base rubberized plastic teeth broke off on a third .
4210,it spent most of the time in my backpack .
4211,negativeshow to tell if it s on or off ?  there no indicator .
4212,i guess that amazon can t keep up with all of their num_extend party providers .
4213,it s like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something .
4214,"yes ,  the coffee pot stays on and there is no turn off switch ."
4215,"your urine should be slightly yellow at best ,  otherwise you are overworking your kidneys ."
4216,so now the unit is useless since there is no way i can charge it anymore .
4217,"but no ,  this container is only for num_num pounds of product ."
4218,the version that is shipping now is a pale imitation of the original .
4219,i do not like the new inventory system one bit .
4220,"now it s down to a science ,  and i have consistently excellent coffee ."
4221,"i ve seen great reviews from others who swear by this product ,  it just didn t work for me ."
4222,"it has a decent story ,  and if you like an old style rpg ,  it starts out feeling ok ."
4223,it does not even help a little bit .
4224,"this one is in between and a good match ,  offers good coverage and is a good value ."
4225,i wasn t able to use the lid with a turkey this large so i used heavy duty foil instead .
4226,i have pretty much given up on the cobraco num_num plant sitter .
4227,"however ,  the cut is too baggy and the shirt is too long which looks sloppy ."
4228,"with some pressure ,  it will reopen . this unit is advertised as effective for mice ,  rats ,  chipmunks ,  and small squirrels ."
4229,i ve gotten rid of mine and switched to a model with only one scoop .
4230,num_num minutes of scrubbing with electric dishwasher powder and clorox was needed to clean it .
4231,"inexpensive networking equipment is made cheaply ,  so defects happen ."
4232,the thing i didn t like about this gamewere it s expectations .
4233,"once the game has lost all the aspects of the mmx series ,  it s over ."
4234,the game itself would be very well had these flaws been dealt with .
4235,the canister requires a chunk of freezer space and must be frozen a day in advance .
4236,the only reason i bought num_num of them was that the little song made my dog so happy .
4237,"they fit ,  but needed to be trimmed on the sides just by a sliver ."
4238,then it started making only half a serving and turning off .
4239,protection is minimal but should be fine if you drop it from a short distance .
4240,i was so excited when i finally made my little spaceship .
4241,this is a great product and worth every penny .
4242,i love exciting games and this one bored me .
4243,she loves it and really likes the color .
4244,i had to do a large burn of over num_num disks for work .
4245,"i was skeptical at first that it would leak between the suction cups ,  but it doesn t seem to ."
4246,in respect to what others have said about static .
4247,goes in and out of my holder and pocket easy enough .
4248,i gave it num_num stars just because the price was ridiculous .
4249,"this was the darkest color i could find ,  but it is working out great ."
4250,there are many reviewers here who complained of coffee leaking out during brewing .
4251,i hope this review helps you with your decisions .
4252,"since i bought this blender ,  i found that i use blender much more often ."
4253,"i needed num_num water glasses to have along with my fine china ,  and i ended up choosing these ."
4254,no issues with the bluetooth fading but i haven t tried going more than num_num ft or so .
4255,very sturdy and nice and small for a countertop .
4256,"clay cat litter sticks to my nostrils like hooker perfume ,  but this stuff doesn t smell much better ."
4257,i m glad i didn t pay any more for it .
4258,"despite the name most americans call them ,  fries come from belgium ."
4259,i wish they could give you the option of colors to choose from !  .
4260,my only complaint about this product is that it stained the first time i used it .
4261,i have take some and shared with friends on facebook .
4262,i m actually using the stylus to write this review .
4263,i rated this scooper num_num because it s too big and too heavy .
4264,i like the ability to be able to buy new blades for it .
4265,"the num_num cup is more capacity than needed ,  since i brew for two persons ."
4266,i was too cheap to get the vitamix and thought i could get by with this waring .
4267,first taste was of the puroast as i did not want to be prejudiced by the regular taste .
4268,"after reading reviews of several options ,  i settled on this one ."
4269,"all sony s have this but for some reason ,  the top of the line palm does not ."
4270,i bought a set for my home as well as the office .
4271,just more painful than it needs to be .
4272,"yeah ,  if you decide to wear it ,  you may think you are braless ."
4273,"i tried  mixing  the shampoo thinking maybe it was thicker at the top ,  but that is not the case ."
4274,i bought the ballistic based upon the reviews of others and it lives up to them .
4275,plus they look sort of silly on your head because of the folding design . the num_extend
4276,i installed it following youtube video and it wasn t that hard .
4277,it is absolutely adorable !  i am sooooo glad i purchased it !  it fits in your pocket just fine .
4278,i am surprised that some people wrote that it takes quite a bit of force .
4279,that game cannot be played any other way but by a computer .
4280,there is also a bit of a grainy taste .
4281,it s better suited as a small water bowl .
4282,i even left this dye on for num_num minutes .
4283,is it supposed to make the game more  adult  or edgy ?  it s just icky .
4284,but the nominal amount is worth it by the aggravation that you save .
4285,"after examining the pot ,  i heard something jingling inside ."
4286,one great thing is that is a pretty thin light cover .
4287,i knocked of a star for two reasons .
4288,this item is simply the best accessory  and i have many  for my new evo num_extend
4289,i bought it used for $ and i still consider it to have been a waste of money .
4290,i went with a griffin survivor after that and never looked back .
4291,this was a christmas present for my son who s taken an interest in baking .
4292,i got this as an early christmas gift cuz of the great sale .
4293,i ve had this charger for over three years and it still works like a charm .
4294,i am a big fan of the oxo steel line .
4295,what a shame that i didn t buy a pallet load of these back in num_extend
4296,this new battery i bought has lasted years !  it s great !  .
4297,feels like it is made to last . too large for dishwasher .
4298,"unfortunatly ,  these never work the way you want them too ."
4299,or seeing a defensive lineman jump four feet in the air to knock a ball down .
4300,this isn t nearly as effective as other otc numbing ointments .
4301,it served me very very well for all these years .
4302,the coffee was not strong enough so i went back to my black and decker .
4303,the xela aramosticks provide an okay scent and looks decorative .
4304,these a big round bones with nothing on the outside .
4305,"after various bad experiences ,  i just avoid this brand ."
4306,"they are heavyweight and work perfectly ,  a good quality product ,  you wont be disappointed ."
4307,both myself and my wife have iphone num_extend running ios num_extend with no problems so far .
4308,"i have enjoyed the original fig newtons ,  but this new cookie was not as pleasing ."
4309,"well designed ,  easy to carry . you will not find a better tote of this ilk anywhere ."
4310,as my experience was when i tried the swiffer wetjet .
4311,"since i love num_num bean burritos ,  this is perfect for making the num_num beans first from dried beans ."
4312,overall this is a very dissapointing and way overpriced first aid kit .
4313,useless !  liquid goes right through the blue plastic and the white lining doesn t hold any liquid at all .
4314,it s easy to clean and machine washable !  no signs of rust at all .
4315,"these are a great bargain and fit perfectly ,  can t hardly tell its even there ."
4316,many pie shield are too heavy and ruin the crust .
4317,it stays in your ear and has plenty of volume to overcome road noise in a car .
4318,tried to clean it to maintain it s clarity but it eventually looked like a yellow case .
4319,"i hate to write bad reviews ,  but i m sorry i can t give zero stars ."
4320,they reproduce very quickly and don t cost a lot to feed .
4321,because of this i could not tell you if this game did a great job of representing the game .
4322,i would send the unopened one back if it did not cost me that much in postage costs .
4323,my jaws felt great in the morning and i didn t have the usual migraine that came with clenching .
4324,my daughter bought this item for me and i have used it so much .
4325,"the bamboo makes it a somewhat attractive board ,  but also means added upkeep ."
4326,so i was super excited to get the num_num quart .
4327,i ve also noticed this particular filter has an inordinate amount of warehouse deals available .
4328,they are the perfect size to slip into the toaster after that .
4329,i live in mexico and the mail can be unkind .
4330,these work great and are small enough that they don t take up much space in my utensil drawer .
4331,"consisting of only num_num lousy fighters ,  the controls on each character have obviously been tweaked into a condensed format ."
4332,my favorite uses are to thinly slice lemons and to finely dice ginger .
4333,be careful and read the video card support list very carefully .
4334,the camera hole did not line up perfectly .
4335,"hey ,  if you re looking for the best pill crusher on the market .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . then look no further than this little item ."
4336,most underwater cases are bulky and cumbersome but the iottie is thin and fits like a glove .
4337,works as advertised but the keys are stiff .
4338,volume controlrequires a adjustment for increasing the volume to hear callers . hope this review will assist in your purchase .
4339,it wasn t anything like any mac and cheese i ve ever eaten .
4340,i also bought the trent limir dual purpose stylus and it is working quite well .
4341,"it s not only great dinnerware ,  but an investment ."
4342,my dog did too on the area around her mouth .
4343,i hope sony get it right with the num_extend next time .
4344,this player is too old and not worth the money .
4345,forget about the num_num grams of fiber per cup .
4346,"i ve loved this pan from the moment i seasoned it ,  and have used it several times a week since ."
4347,the black one looks great and doesn t look bad with the white accents .
4348,but serves the purpose of people on the run well  .
4349,these cheaper cock rings usually don t hold up for long and this one was no exception .
4350,so basically :  you can only charge the juice pack when plugged into power  not the iphone  .
4351,"i used num_num drops in an ice cream called  savannah buttermint  ,  and it added a substantial ,  deep butter flavor ."
4352,i will probably get higher rings once the zeroing part is taken care of .
4353,if you don t press on the black part or anything then it s fine .
4354,no complaints on either end with call clarity or volume .
4355,i ordered this one real cheap here on amazon .
4356,the reviews seem to be written by honest people who want to share there experiences .
4357,there were just a few features that i would have liked to have on this headset though .
4358,the blade rusted to the point it was too dull to use .
4359,they weren t bad enough to bother with returning the set though .
4360,i don t have to drink another shake and can eat ice cream for lunch without guilt .
4361,"he was a little leery about the kickstand ,  but it s very unobtrusive ."
4362,she wanted a large round pearl or mother of pearl pendant to match some earrings she already owned .
4363,some protectors have a clingy feel that cause the finger to skip across the screen instead of glide .
4364,"as with anything ,  toddlers pick up there toys ,  and then usually drop or throw them ."
4365,"had it been tight ,  i m certain it would have broken the steal ."
4366,"the fact that i am should illustrate how good this thing is ,  as is everything i own from oxo ."
4367,it s my back up for my plantronics num_extend
4368,"they do look attractive ,  but as for usefulness ,  i wish i would have just bought a simple squirt bottle ."
4369,"trident  strawberry twist  sugarless gum is very disappointing ,  both in taste and consistency ."
4370,the sound from the philips headset is much clearer .
4371,i still followed the directions by choosing small areas to cover .
4372,i can barely stomach it and agree that i would rather eat salad plain than with this dressing .
4373,"instructions claim that if large portions of the pan are left exposed ,  it will be damaged ."
4374,"lengthwise they fit perfectly ,  but they feel like they pinch after i wear them for a period ."
4375,i recently braised short ribs with this and it turned out terrific .
4376,they try to blame it on the system or your sound card or anything but their software .
4377,"my opinion of herb teas ,  which i call weed teas ,  has been negative ."
4378,"choke up the extra $ and get the travelon ,  you ll be glad you did ."
4379,what does helps with digestion for me is good ole ginger root .
4380,"easy to use ,  easy to clean ,  and keeps hot water all day ,  what more could you ask for ?  ."
4381,"to check his blood sugar ,  and the price was right ."
4382,this is a nice to have accessory as most items now are usb based .
4383,i guess i m not having that much luck with bluetooth earpieces .
4384,i would like to know who thought of that brilliant design ? food does fall down into little cracks and crevices .
4385,"still giving it num_num stars though ,  for including the crappy usb cable ."
4386,so i tend to grind a bunch at ones .
4387,"i tried to ignore the smell ,  but within five minutes or so i just had to wash it off ."
4388,dishwasher safe and may use an abrasive cleaner .
4389,"yes ,  nancy spends a frustrating amount of time collecting and analyzing bug poop ."
4390,"it scares the animals in my grooming shop ,  and the tip is hard to get on ."
4391,the other ones would stop sending packets in the middle of a trasfer .
4392,if you are just looking for a moisturizer then be my guest and buy this product .
4393,i tried to find out more about this product before trying it .
4394,it s tough to beat black num_extend greater heat sensitivity .
4395,i want to design it by evolving it a specific way to get that trait .
4396,filters are easy to remove and replace for cleaning .
4397,that s why i felt the quality was not good .
4398,my feet are badly calloused from the poor support of these shoes .
4399,these shower curtain rings look and work exactly as described and seem sturdy enough to me .
4400,i bought the transparent green with yellow bristles one as it is a snazzy looking combination which i like .
4401,even my cheap num_extend num_extend is significantly sharper . one reviewer said it s sharp on all four corners; not mine .
4402,easy to hang up and looks pretty cool in the kitchen too .
4403,the new balance shoes itself is already good insole .
4404,but i look at it as a investment for my feet .
4405,the box is actually around the same size as the box an iphone comes in !  .
4406,i got this pot because i was tired of using num_num different dishes to make stock .
4407,"it kept barking commands to put the stylus on the screen to trace the letter ,  like num_num times ."
4408,this model requires more interaction than a percolator or drip coffeemaker .
4409,my favorite brands of prepared boxed bread mixes are hodgson mill and fleischman .
4410,i bought two of these and thought at first they were great .
4411,so a scale with a detachable plate will tend to live longer . the escali alimento has covered buttons .
4412,i did not even attempt to use this when i got it .
4413,i simply place it on top of the breville smart stove baking accessories .
4414,my second unit which was replaced by philips just developed the same problem as the unit it replaced .
4415,it would also be nice to have intermediate size markings on the cups . overall these seem quite good .
4416,and the plate sizes aren t the least bit deceptive in my opinion .
4417,"i sent it back to be replaced ,  and i got the same ,  wrong product ."
4418,i purchased four of these and gave three away .
4419,have it in my car and use it when needed .
4420,"when the first armada came out ,  i was hooked ."
4421,definitely would recommend this one to anyone who doesn t want to spend big $ on a coffee grinder .
4422,if it is broken it won t take much to replace it .
4423,they also take twice as long to charge compared to amazon s and the charge does not last any longer .
4424,saves time when onions or garlic are needed in a recipe .
4425,i took a sample and applied every day on my honeymoon in thailand .
4426,the plus is it will use any ac micro usb charger .
4427,"really sleek phone case ,  however if you are looking for a protective case this is not that ."
4428,i use one part chocolate to num_num or num_num parts sugar .
4429,this fits and locks with a  thumbscrew  type expander in a cd slot .
4430,yo get exactly what you order in a timely fashion .
4431,"however ,  the motor died num_num hours into the third use ."
4432,i have received several compliments and questions regarding where they can get their own .
4433,the cover stops chunks of stuff from getting into the broth but doesn t inhibit the flow into the cup .
4434,it is easy to use and when i wear this one out i will buy another to replace it .
4435,"what a joke ! it s like starcraft with bad graphics ,  zilch instructions and awful controls ."
4436,this has been much less expensive than buying bottled water .
4437,can a towel holder be cool ?  yes !  simple elegant design with a very functional ratcheting mechanism .
4438,ive personally had these damage a system and ruin games .
4439,i have heard other people have had success with it but we did not .
4440,i was expecting it to be heavy but it was several pounds heavier than i expected .
4441,"on the other hand ,  i have to turn my num_extend down slightly on some num_extend"
4442,the company was willing to replace but i didn t bother .
4443,"i love rpgs and especially the final fantasy series ,  along with dungeon crawlers  such as dark cloud and zelda  ."
4444,need to return; dogs irritate eyes and cant be used on them .
4445,"get a droid or wait and pay $ for a nexus ,  i just don t know ."
4446,as pots and pans have gotten more heat efficient they have also become heavier .
4447,i could not find this set in any store locally .
4448,you don t have any real control over what s happening at this point .
4449,"well they fit fine in the front ,  but not so much in the back ."
4450,it was a bit confusing to get so many parts in the accessory kit .
4451,"we eat a lot of salads ,  and very much enjoy the peppermill ."
4452,got this little unit to replace the tv ears i had been using for some time .
4453,"after trying petarmour which didn t work ,  i read all the reviews on frontline and tried it ."
4454,i do see some diarrhea outside that i hadn t noticed before  i wasn t really looking for it  .
4455,"it was very bad quality product ,  the screen was broke with a simple fall down ."
4456,it is effective for that purpose and does seem to keep a room cooler .
4457,so i got online at   .  .  .   and found this charging pod .
4458,i use this for business calls for hours and music on airplanes .
4459,"if thats what you ll carry ,  then you might like it ."
4460,"as it s deeper than most microwaves ,  the feet barely make it onto the shelf at the front ."
4461,"when my wife says ,   do you want some tea ?   she is only talking about hot and in a cup ."
4462,they re a little pricey but you get a quality product for that price .
4463,i am yet another victim of this disastrous drive !  lacie advertise this as being compatible with windows xp .
4464,"i bought this item two weeks ago ,  and it was not what i expected from it ."
4465,"spooning the chopped food out of the container was very easy ,  and the clean up was likewise ."
4466,"for one ,  maybe two people it works great ."
4467,"my point is that wrigley s does an effective job at selling their gum ,  due to the packaging ."
4468,i have a pair of perfectly slimming bermuda shorts in size num_num and i love them .
4469,"when i was growing up ,  we had an old hand cranck meat slicer ."
4470,there is no charging capabilities with this stand .
4471,beef will shrink and lose its water after cooking .
4472,"but reading some of the reviews online here ,  i questioned if i may also experience issues ."
4473,but for me it was a low cost charger and works perfect with my samsung num_extend
4474,"no ,  i am not a scientist but i am literate ."
4475,some people claim that it is not stiff enough and collapses around the top .
4476,i can t afford to constantly drop my phone on the ground .
4477,"they are great quality ,  and ,  clean up easy ."
4478,"of the num_num softgels ,  about num_num of them were cracked or had chipped ."
4479,if they were priced closer to $ then i would approve .
4480,use it to charge samsung epic num_extend num_extend and anker batteries so far works great and great price .
4481,since the day one i am using this product .
4482,a few days if you have no applications open .
4483,"so ,  we did that and have been using one of them for a few months ."
4484,i keep the daddy in the refrigerator between uses with the oil in it .
4485,"in addition ,  the awkward placement of the buttons on the game boy advance can be very frustrating ."
4486,"i just make sure that the berries are not whole ,  and the blender works just fine ."
4487,nothing added !  you can add whatever you want after it has popped .
4488,okay i ordered it because i wanted more thicker hair .
4489,i can t believe how simple it is to use .
4490,you can hear it outside the house with the windows closed .
4491,i use it to remove pizza from my oven .
4492,"i really like that you can mount the case on your belt or backpack ,  in any combination of ways ."
4493,"this boot is a rain magnet ,  i had so much water in these it could be dumped out ."
4494,"this is a good ,  standard piece of kitchen equipment ."
4495,and you kinda  want a grinder that won t break . there are surprisingly few grinders sold that meet these requirements .
4496,many more products like that and i will look to other retailers .
4497,the coffee also tastes the same as what was produced by the larger counter top unit .
4498,first of all for the non technically inclined they should have some sort of user manual .
4499,"i have two whisks ,  this one ,  and a silicone covered whisk ."
4500,i have the latest and greatest versions and i am still experiencing the problems described above .
4501,adding to the bulk is a rubberized band around the edges .
4502,"also ,  bpa in plastic might be a health concren for some ."
4503,"i use it with no oil ,  and it comes out great ."
4504,one has broken and another is frayed on one of the straps .

4514,i know what satsuma products are supposed to smell like .
4515,the three the game gives you are the three you get .
4516,"you ll probably only do it because it looks cool ,  but it s almost suicide in some cases ."
4517,"also ,  it s not really queen size ,  as advertised ."
4518,"but due to additional costs ,  i bought a white one to match our kitchen ."
4519,i have a local biz and i do well .
4520,it fits my samsung galaxy num_extend and my daughters htc evo and htc evo shift .
4521,they are just inferior razors that are wrongly designed .
4522,i won t buy a product from this manufacturer again and i m looking for a new curling iron .
4523,i bought this for my son as a soccer training tool .
4524,what a cheap trick for wilton to cut back on quality in an effort to save money .
4525,i plugged it in to make some guac and nothing .
4526,"i was concerned when i first got this slow cooker that it was too small ,  it looked so tiny ."
4527,it feels solid and i completely forget that i have it on .
4528,bought for my daugther in law and she loves it .
4529,we bought this to use as french onion soup dishes .
4530,it has a nice led light on it that puts a nice look to it .
4531,you can adjust the volume if it is too loud .
4532,"too bad ,  because it has a nice look overall ."
4533,"until durability issues are resolved ,  i can t recommend these boots ."
4534,"i will need to try that out ,  but it does not excuse ernie ball from their responsibility ."
4535,but it wasn t at all what i was expecting .
4536,"over time ,  there is an inevitable stain buildup but i have not found this to affect flavor ."
4537,these aren t tips !  !  !  i received the whole nail ones .
4538,the bristles are rough and come apart easily .
4539,it makes baking much more pleasurable . this tool has so many uses .
4540,the rental machines do a much better job .
4541,"this is perfect for making turnovers or  jacks  filled with fruit ,  sweet or savory fillings ."
4542,i sat down in front of the computer and opened the packages . inside i found instructions and the products .
4543,"the ad was promising ,  but the results did not justify the claims ."
4544,i also have an issue with the bottle .
4545,"not only that ,  the num_num spare batteries also charged up in my phone when i had it plugged in ."
4546,"this thing is really heavy and takes up a lot of counter space ,  but it works as advertised ."
4547,i bought this a christmas gift for my husband .
4548,except your an exiled jedi they call  the exile  .  .  .  .  . wow the cheese is strong in this one .
4549,it was awesome !  these are the right size for everyday glasses and fit your hand well .
4550,this is a very well made fan and it generates plenty of air even on the lowest setting .
4551,i ve only had it for one day and have already used all attachments .
4552,it can also be a lot of fun .
4553,"so ,  you pay $ for a relex sight ."
4554,or buy final fantasy x that doesn t require a tv .
4555,it s a bit darker than my aqua kitchenaid but it matches beautifully in my kitchen .
4556,"yes ,  it will function and give good sound ,  but you re dealing with an inferior product ."
4557,it is hard to control and poorly positioned almost always when you let it go on its own .
4558,the game itself has plenty of bad flaws . i used to love warcraft .
4559,i enjoy how easy it is to use and to clean  i also love hot chocolate  .
4560,my sit bones are between num_extend and num_extend apart .
4561,"the finish is good ,  the lid is quite nice ."
4562,the long handle means people hold the strainer far from the glass .
4563,i guess i ll keep it incase he grows .
4564,the high frequencies rattled and sounded tinny like there was a loose connector inside the casing .
4565,it does not seem to be quite as well built as the fans i purchased in num_extend
4566,maybe amazon should drop this company s products to avoid disappointing its customers ?  .
4567,"it still works great ,  just that it doesnt have a cupped headset to cover my ear ."
4568,i bought this today to see what i thought .
4569,"while they seemed wasteful and expensive ,  they were both quick and effective ."
4570,but do we have to pay more for less processed items ? unbleached means one step less in the production process .
4571,then the whole thing fell apart after a few months .
4572,the earbud occasionally comes out of my earlobe and the headset just hangs from my ear .
4573,"i bought one of these for my home office ,  and one for my living room ."
4574,"this package does not include the frame which is a necessity ,  making this product somewhat useless ."
4575,"besides the fact they don t work ,  they are confusing and limited the way they are formatted ."
4576,the material and tool actually make the difference .
4577,i bought this battery pack for my wife prior to our planned plane trip to hawaii .
4578,i cannot even test it to see if it works .
4579,it does not sit properly and provides too much resistance .
4580,i love this pan and will keep the two i purchased .
4581,i love them they go with almost anything that you may have .
4582,"agreeing with the same reviewer ,  i could not stomach this stuff ."
4583,"it washes up nicely ,  so it will be awhile before i have to buy more ."
4584,stick to the normal gummy bears ! please do listen to the other reviewers .
4585,the absolute worst dreamcast game i have ever played .
4586,those of us concerned with such things as human rights and the american economy are concerned about such omissions .
4587,"on top of a printer ,  usb keyboard ,  etc ."
4588,they make the perfect order filler to get free shipping .
4589,i will have many baking uses for my new cutter .
4590,it isn t all that expensive and you have already invested quite a bit to get a good blade .
4591,it s so soft as to be almost mushy .
4592,this is the num_extend case i ve bought for my num_extend
4593,"sorry to say ,  it is not worth much ."
4594,"very easy ,  very quick ,  very efficient .  .  . and of course .  .  . no searching for outlets !  !  ."
4595,this is identical to having thugs come in and smash your computer .
4596,pros :  very durable son liked it since it was introduced early on and he didn t have many other options .
4597,she gave me two cast iron pans that was her mothers .
4598,"this puzzle ,  received on her second birthday ,  presented no challenge at all ."
4599,"that was my biggest complaint about previous irons ,  that wimpy little wisp of steam ."
4600,"with data . to start with i do experience occasional heartburn ,  reflux ,  etc ,  so this was a very exciting taste test ."
4601,"it has great sound ,  features ,  fit ,  and looks ."
4602,i have had the water on at the house for a few days and see no problem with leaking .
4603,as a protective case and provides extra batterytime .
4604,"it does ,  and makes great coffee to boot ."
4605,"it comes with only a few songs ,  and none of them are sung in their entirety ."
4606,"but you need a food processor for grating ,  and for chopping dry stuff ."
4607,"i downgraded to this one since it s a simple ,  single piece with no parts or attachments to break ."
4608,i try not to eat to much bread for health reasons .
4609,"i will try to post some pics . it won t let me add a photos ,  which is a shame ."
4610,it barely scratched up either !  i love it !  !  !  .
4611,i have used her num_num inch chef s knife and although i think that wusthof is mostly junk .
4612,i was surprised the potatoes did not get overly soft since i d left them in the whole time .
4613,get the picture ?  just soak your feet and buy a file .
4614,madden is lame and ea is a retarded game maker .
4615,this is a ncie little cutter and works exactly as it should .

4617,i ve been a brita user for a long time .
4618,first what is pictured is not what i was sent .
4619,i cannot imagine what these people are doing to this thing saying it bogs down with a little pressure .
4620,"it s not a perfect solution ,  but it works ."
4621,it cleans my tile and wood floors beautifully before i mop .
4622,used it a few months and used the clean cycle .
4623,"i didn t actually realize it when i bought them ,  but they are full featured phone headsets with mics too ."
4624,update :  we have now been using this canner for several months .
4625,this knife handles well and is very sharp .
4626,"i couldnt keep playing this game ,  i would rather die ,  seriously ."
4627,i handed him the phone and the plastic sheet but he said it is useless to even try .
4628,"i checked to make sure the battery was placed properly  it was  ,  reinserted several times ,  but to no avail ."
4629,don t have to charge it as often as my older one and has a longer stand by when using .
4630,"the first thing i noticed is this is a quality item ,  except theplastic knob ."
4631,the odds of something not fitting or being different are just too high .
4632,"works like a charm ,  does what i want ."
4633,great filter for the honeywell room air filtration system .
4634,"i like the  forks  on the tip to pick up the tomato slices ,  or pickles or onions ."
4635,the stove burned from the central hole for num_num minutes before the stove num_extend
4636,i really wish sango could improve this set .
4637,"these sheets are very well made ,  very heavy and i have never experienced warping with these sheets ."
4638,"so beware of this bargain product ,  because you won t even get what you pay for ."
4639,this was a disappointing  macaroni and cheese  product .
4640,"my koi are active and voracious eaters ,  or were should i say ."
4641,"does the job intended ,  so it is ,  as advertised ."
4642,it works really well and is easy to take apart and clean .
4643,"the top and bottom didn t seat correctly ,  they kept falling into each other ."
4644,this product is durable and effective for the active cook .
4645,"once this headset arrived ,  i put it to use ."
4646,i give this num_num stars for the junky sheath that come with it .
4647,i needed a usb wire that would wind back up after use instead of laying around looking messy .
4648,"stainless always does great ,  works well no matter liquid or solid ."
4649,you can clean this out and replace the batteries and it might work again .
4650,"overall ,  it took a month for me to get the product and then the product was just ok ."
4651,then i noticed a little silkworm next to the pack .
4652,how nice is to be able to keep all the food processor tools right in one spot .
4653,most green teas are green in color and yield a yellow brew .
4654,with the smallest of the num_num not much larger than my hand .
4655,they snap off of the ring that holds the cups all together very easily .
4656,tonight is the first time i am using it .
4657,the vehicles just feel weightless and ridiculously unreal .
4658,i liked the specs for the new trent itorch num_extend num_num and also liked how it looked .
4659,it slows and even comes to a stop depending on you hold it .
4660,"while it s not the device s fault ,  it s hard to align if the apple s core isn t directly beneath it s stem ."
4661,they do not really sanitize although you could probably put a couple drops of bleach in the water .
4662,can t ask for more than num_num years service .
4663,of course there is mining and resource management .
4664,i thought it would be detrimental to the sear and add to the pan s stickiness .
4665,"no tiny hole or anything so you re getting very clear ,  filtered coffee ."
4666,if you need to fix a broken denture i would recommend taking it to someone that makes dentures .
4667,"a tiny bit of egg stuck in the pan ,  but not much ,  and the pancakes browned nicely ."
4668,the last song that mouse should performed to xelpherpolis was so difficult .
4669,i wear mine on the hand i use to twist blades in and out of housing .
4670,"not very educational ,  but she she had fun chasing it around the house ."
4671,none of the pellets would fit in my hatsan striker edge .
4672,will work great and and should have plenty left for later on .
4673,i bought this tumbler along with the insulated tropix tumblers of the same size .
4674,"the inner boot is not lined ,  only the shaft is ."
4675,"this is a hollow toy ,  not made for strong chewers ."

4677,i mainly scoop rice balls with this thing and it works great .
4678,have some in my desk at work just to hand out !  love em !  !  .
4679,the funnel is num_extend long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only num_extend long .
4680,it seems like something is mixed in it and it smells different .
4681,original review : it goes on a little bit like sunscreen .  .  . same consistency and same smell minus most of the shine .
4682,not sure if anybody else is experiencing this issue but figured i d update my review as such .
4683,the only redeeming quality is that the mix for the ice cream tastes pretty good .
4684,you turn the dial back to the center when you have enough espresso .
4685,it doesn t work at all . after you do that the cd should be like new .
4686,this is really a great tool for baking .
4687,you can put a lot in a small space .
4688,yes i would tell my friends abot this if they had a smart phone .
4689,the  sandbag  base is surprisingly and pleasantly heavy to give the unit some stability on the dashboard . highly recommended .
4690,it isn t like starfleet command is the only one of its kind .
4691,great case for the money light weight feels great in your hand .
4692,it was kind of ruff and it still smelled .
4693,"also ,  akoya pearls have a nice ,  lustrous sheen ."

4698,it s great for a small fridge like mine .
4699,"seriously ,  you pour in num_num oz or more of water and in about num_num mins its done ."
4700,i am really surprised by all the reviews saying that those suppositories were so soothing .
4701,the first and only can i tried was warm and tasted lke straight seltzer .
4702,i can t imagine using it for more than very small extension cords .
4703,"i do like this organizer for sweaters ,  jeans ,  etc ."
4704,i got this for storing and securing items in my soft top jeep   num_num jk   .
4705,i set a timer for num_num and a half minutes and they come out perfectly every time .
4706,its not uncomfortable but it could be better as well .
4707,this product was not at all what i was expecting .
4708,listen to all of the num_num star reviews on this page because they are very true .
4709,if you want something made better that lasts longer you ll have to pay more .
4710,excelente producto para usar en el carro y cargar todo los tipos de aparatos apple .
4711,i got my crock pot the day after thanksgiving for $ and it came with a bonus divided insert .
4712,"as much as i wanted to like these earrings ,  these might be going back ."
4713,"it may have a few scratches ,  but it s still running strong as ever ."
4714,"this works much better ,  the only drawback being the frequency at which it has to be refilled ."
4715,finely tuned audiophiles may wish to look elsewhere .
4716,this pot is slimmer than a lot of saucepans but it s a bit taller .
4717,"the drum hardly does anything ,  and barely holds my daughter s interest for more than a minute or so ."
4718,little hotties promised num_num hours of heat and gave me num_extend
4719,odd and disturbing enough to make me not use the cream .
4720,"the clasps broke off  both  and we cannot get them reattached ,  even the way melissa and doug says to ."
4721,"if i could have given this product zero stars ,  i would have ."
4722,i bought one for myself as well to take to my office .
4723,i will be taking my future business elsewhere .
4724,i preordered this game and played it as soon as it arrived .
4725,love it but takes a bit long to charge and battery runs out quickly sometimes .
4726,i bought this for my wife s white iphone num_num to protect it from our num_num year old son .
4727,buying from amazon is definetly the cheaper route .
4728,"it s durable ,  pretty ,  and works from refrigerator to microwave or oven ."
4729,"they end up breaking after around num_num months ,  but for $ who cares ?  great product ."
4730,as consumers we have the power to flex our muscle and tighten our grip on our wallets .
4731,"and yes ,  dusts do not stick to this cover ."
4732,for whatever reason the colored enamel on this has gotten dirty quicker than all my other le creuset .
4733,the bottle tops are a little flimsy but still fine  and seal tightly  .
4734,they both love it and i would recommend this to anyone .
4735,rubber is way to soft they all num_num tore within three days .
4736,"i am not a fan of snakes and when i opened the box ,  it made me cringe ."
4737,do yourself a favor and take a look at those others before buying this one .
4738,even gourmet pet food offers real chunks of meat .
4739,"the machine does gurgle but very easy to correctin sum ,  i m happy to have gotten this product ."
4740,this little movement was not very noticable or bothersome .
4741,"i recently loaded it up with memory for a trip ,  with documents which i needed ."
4742,i bought these shears to go with my shun knives .
4743,then the casing fell apart after a month .
4744,works great even if it is a bit difficult for us older folks who are all thumbs .
4745,i would check stores first to price compare .
4746,"i recommend this fan without hesitation ,  and i am someone who generally prefers vornados ."
4747,"for example ,  today ,  the telephone dialer application crashed ."
4748,"after only about num_num months ,  the rubber seal was pulling out of the plastic support pieces of the plunger ."
4749,"and there s a variety of levels ,  like the jungle or the thief hideout or the cloud level ."
4750,if everything worked i could live with the fobs and the big sensors and the expense .
4751,"other than that ,  a good value for the money ."
4752,if i were keeping it i think i would cut it out .
4753,this was my first venture into the pda world and i am sorely dissapointed .
4754,i have had my kitchenaid num_extend stand mixer since num_num and have never had any problem with it whatsoever .
4755,"i ve owned many hair curlers ,  and i was looking for one that offered large rollers and fast heat up ."
4756,still thinking of my first one i ordered another one .
4757,if that doesn t bother you then this is the case to get .
4758,"the button still works so that it will make a call or whatever ,  but i can t hear anything ."
4759,most of the reviewers summed this game up quite well .
4760,i saw it first on america s test kitchen website .
4761,the next vacuum i get will have to have that .
4762,it will be ready for the next time ! i have other plans for this pan too .
4763,they come from england and each toaster is hand built by the same person from start to finish .
4764,"once it was gone ,  i realized it had just been masking the smell and it was still present ."
4765,the chute on the shield is most helpful when gradually adding ingredients .
4766,he basically threw himself backwards when i put him on this .
4767,i got it for my father in law and we loved it .
4768,so it s sitting on a shelf on m garage .
4769,"although this one will do such tasks ,  putting fine detail on the screen is difficult ."
4770,you d be better off wrapping your rounds in razor blades and trying to shove them into the gun .
4771,they cost much less and have the same lifetime guarantee .
4772,"the ends are quite unfinished ,  not rounded off ,  i . e ."
4773,"for example ,  one person said ,   i hit the finalize button ."
4774,four days later i still have itching red spots and lumps on all areas of contact .
4775,it smells very synthetic and just not good; too sickeningly sweet .
4776,just not one of my fav bras by this company .
4777,no longer is great skill or herculean strength required in order to enjoy a good bottle of wine .
4778,it would probably be better it that plastic was not installed as a default .
4779,"i ve purchased num_num of them ,  all work great ."
4780,"the features work ,  but the higher end dual is a better deal ."
4781,it is so easy to maneuver it around the house you almost forget its following you .
4782,this is more than worth the miniscule investment .
4783,it looks cool but isn t a practical choice for a kid .
4784,"it s the real deal ,  great quality at a good price and it s big !  num_extend qt ."
4785,the combs did not even fit the oster num_extend unit .
4786,"especially if your knife is used like a tool for cutting vines ,  twigs ,  branches ,  and even digging ."
4787,"if the connection gets lost ,  a recorded voice says the headset is disconnected ."
4788,would recomend it and would buy as a gift .
4789,"for my first case ,  i love it and so will you ."
4790,"but ,  i started to mull over the healthiness of instant coffee ."
4791,not only is it cute looking but it makes a mean foam on top too .

5025,this product is not worth much time  or money  so here s a list of the num_extend
5026,had to use amazon mediation to get my money back .
5027,if you expect it to support you and be wearable as a sexy undergarment .
5028,probably not made for the real heavy duty stuff .
5029,that means you have to watch it if you do not want overdone waffles .
5030,this type of things flies in the face of actual simulation and just plain ruins the game .
5031,"since i only got the unit ,  i cannot say anything about the brewer stopping halfway through the process ."
5032,"i m a huge final fantasy guy ,  but for me ,  num_num is just very close to trash ."

5047,"went to use it last week ,  spritzing the inside of my car ."
5048,just attach around the overflow drain and fill the tub .

5050,that s on whoever designed this phone to be difficult to fix .
5051,"instantly works with itunes to play music ,  your gps app to read you directions ."

5068,there should be a way of actually making it zero star .
5069,had one of these in my old house .
5070,"you have to  earn  your rating ,  so to speak ."
5071,otherwise this is a great headset .  .  . wish the sound was better would have given num_num stars .

5152,he has enjoyed his complete set but this skillet he uses the most .
5153,i wasn t happy with some of the inactive ingredients in this product .
5154,"a dull one ,  sure ,  but there s an implied sharpness underneath it ."
5155,i particularly picked this one over other models because of the num_num amp num_extend output .
5156,this fan is one of num_num that work without flaws .
5157,"if you need something to actually hold your brows in place ,  this isn t it ."
5158,well done ! i ve owned a mophie juice pack air for about a year .
5159,"all in all it is a good case ,  but probably will not be purchasing this type again ."
5160,the item itself is very flimsy like other users have stated .
5161,"if you plan to use it once ,  this may be good enough ."
5162,"one needs to lay the can opener down sideways ,  on top of the can ,  at just the right position ."
5163,it looks like i am the odd one out .
5164,at night time that feature would of been great if it only worked .
5165,"the stuff lasts what seems like forever ,  it didn t stop burning for hours ."

5179,they were preparing apples to go into a dehydrator .
5180,"well ,  this flashlight does not shine any light at all  yes ,  i changed the batteries multiple times  ."
5181,the sky is the limit in burr grinders that can cost well over $
5182,i ordered my size but it fits very tight and i couldn t get it on so i returned it .
5183,"but i do a lot of bread and pizza ,  so it wasn t going to work ."
5184,couldn t be beat at the time i purchased  that i could find in a quick search of course  .
5185,that s a pretty big error for oven cooking .
5186,i have given these for gifts and also have had two sets of them over the years .
5187,i have this in my phone it works .
5188,"i haven t put it in the freezer ,  but it microwaves just fine ."
5189,"i ve used other external chargers ,  and the itorch is much more compact and fits well in the hand ."
5190,the salmon looks like baby food but it is tasty .
5191,the teeth are still straight unlike other peelers i ve had in the past .
5192,that is why lodge does not do it .
5193,i liked that it was stainless steel and had some sort of feet .
5194,recommed you cut out a template to ensure you order the correct size for your kitchen .
5195,"purchased as a back up case ,  fits perfectly ,  looks nice ,  works great ."
5196,the remaining portion of the food has now hit the trash can .
5197,i bought the first pair based on positive reviews and was not disappointed .
5198,you d think this would be a lot more fun but it was weak and didn t work correctly .
5199,on more then one occasion its found itself overboard .
5200,you can access all of the buttons on the fac of the phone .
5201,i don t make my espresso any other way .
5202,"i originally bought these because when i wear short sleeve shirts ,  my undershirt sleeves often show ."
5203,i can t see who calls neither can i dial cos its a touch screen .
5204,"i mainly funnel thick liquids ,  such as shampoo ,  so this is a real pain ."
5205,much more stable than the previous one that got broken .
5206,"very fuzzy ,  hard to get into car tape deck ."
5207,i put it in the dishwasher because it says you can .
5208,the staiirs are totally useless even for a num_num lb puppy .
5209,i bought this to groom my cat and specifically chose this model because it said it was quiet .
5210,so i m not really sure how well it works in the long run .
5211,i love the heck out of my atrix and i use it for everything .
5212,this is the worst kitchen appliance i ve ever owned .
5213,i also purchased the amish country popcorn and every kernel popped .
5214,"quality is sufficient ,  hasn t rusted on us yet ,  and has a small compartment for a little nutmeg nut itself ."

5216,"so ,  i sanded it all over with num_num grit paper ,  then with num_extend then with num_extend"
5217,"much prefer this style pan top ,  instead of glass tops that break ."
5218,this bra feels good for about the first num_num hours you wear it .
5219,i d use the top sometimes when we went out of town and needed a second litter box .
5220,i received this product and it looks like a total knock off .
5221,and the bass is majorly lacking when using this unit . the connection did not seem to be consistent .
5222,i only want to cook one at a time so i do not eat to much salt or sugar .
5223,one can get an equally low security cable lock which weighs far less and is more compact .
5224,it was either getting to cold or getting too warm .
5225,and that is what you purchase with anything in the oxo good grips line of products .
5226,my wife uses this to charge her nexus num_extend and it works relatively well .
5227,it keeps the coffee hot  there is a num_num hour shutoff  .

5231,"the doll broke very quickly ,  the leg joint broke ,  and then we lost an arm ."
5232,"the baking is great; i ve made small cakes ,  biscuits ,  scones ,  and casseroles using the convection feature ."
5233,the light relief website does not allow any other payments but credit cards . the unit i received is damaged .
5234,i don t think the limitation of this recorder justifies the price .
5235,"you see ,  the highroller uses plastic covers to conceal the screws and has no locking mechanism like the frontloader ."
5236,"that ,  and we had to buy a new industrial cookie sheet ."
5237,"it is sturdy ,  but so light i  an average size woman  can handle it by myself ."
5238,they had to put a weird plastic peice of junk around the battery .
5239,i really liked how you interact more with your family and raise your son .
5240,trust me on this .  .  . never try a coffee that describes it s taste as leather and tobacco .
5241,i purchased this percolator because i wanted stainless steel and i generally trust the farberware name .
5242,the hooks slide along the rail for easy adjustment .
5243,way too expensive to have something fall apart so quickly .
5244,nothing but flimsy cardboard shoved inside cheap plastic .
5245,they had everything ready and waiting and were very helpful .
5246,"do not put in dishwasher ,  and this goes for any wooden cutting board ."
5247,"it has a very nice cover ,  but that s it ."
5248,"please ,  please don t waste $ dollars on this garbage ."
5249,"right size for boiling water on stove for one ,  num_num oz ,  mug ."
5250,"i like many old brands , i tend to be loyal ."
5251,that way it didn t run out before i was about to get it into the bird .
5252,it charges my phone when i can t get home to fully charge it .
5253,"absolutely magnificent in every type of use :  mostly in the kitchen ,  but any task ,  was accomplished perfectly ."
5254,the plug doesn t even have a ground pole .
5255,the cables run up in side the telescoping rod .
5256,"if this review were based on the first week ,  it would have gotten num_num stars ."
5257,"it will not charge my phone ,  it won t even stay plugged in ,  very loose connection ."
5258,"this product is a nice idea ,  but i ended up giving it away ."
5259,"everything continues to be consistent without any flux in flavor , carbonation or color ."
5260,"perfect for all those small jobs like grilled cheese ,  frozen pizza ,  bagel pizza ,  etc ."
5261,we mainly use it for parmesan cheese and it s perfect .
5262,"don t use the smallest knife much ,  but it s not canning season yet ."
5263,if this happens again with them i am going to send them such an angry email .
5264,decided to go with this since i know cuisinart makes good kitchen products .
5265,granted tastes differ and you might get by with less shots .
5266,had it since num_num and i haven t used it as much as i intended .
5267,may be for younger kids it would be fun .
5268,"it holds a lot of food ,  cooks evenly and cleans up beautifully ."
5269,"with the iphone ,  the phone stays connected while dangling and doesn t disconnect and crash to the floor ."
5270,i always wanted one with a notepad built in and was excited to see the moleskine ipad case .
5271,"also ,  i m a gadget person and really didn t expect this to work as well as it did ."
5272,lasted just over num_num months and burnt out .
5273,my favorite thing to do so far is to slice sweet potatoes and bake sweet potato fries .
5274,took another dose during the day and had the same reaction .
5275,"the full num_num cups took about num_num minutes to boil if i used cold ,  refrigerated water ."
5276,"i live alone ,  but like to bake for gifts and monthly card parties ."
5277,this case looks great with my black iphone num_extend
5278,"both dogs were kept mostly on the trail ,  both dogs did brush against the grass ."
5279,"i would have thought that these wouldn t be so good for working out ,  but i was wrong ."
5280,the bad is it only lasted about num_extend weeks before it stopped squeaking .
5281,"once it did work the music was obnoxiously loud ,  and there is no volume control ."
5282,i have been drinking tea in the loose leaf variety for about a year now .
5283,what s that expression ?  never judge a book by its cover .
5284,"they sent me another one ,  only to find the problem still existed ."
5285,the gloss finish on the sides seem to show sweat more as well .
5286,"it s quite ,  so if u dont wanna wake up ur families choose this num_extend"
5287,they stick well and have not come off my phone since i put it on two weeks ago .
5288,i love these fruit scoops !  makes scooping out kiwi easier .
5289,"the armor case is solidly built ,  high quality ."
5290,"it doesn t ruin your game permanently ,  but it ruins itself just fine ."
5291,"as other reviewers have noted ,  the packs now contain vermicelli mixed in with the rice ."
5292,"after watching the salesperson crank out an entire salad in under num_num minutes ,  i wanted it ."
5293,"not in my chosen colour  meringue  ,  but in glossy white ."
5294,"overall it does work ,  it just leaves a icky oily feeling ."
5295,we used to rent the rug doctore for our carpets .
5296,or maybe a lawnmower in the dead of winter .
5297,a screwdriver could easily get this mechanism open .
5298,trust me on this !   .  .  .  .  . now if you use num_extend it drains your battery quickly .
5299,"another con is also a pro ,  the appliance itself is very heavy ."
5300,this lodge hhmt max temp handle mitt is well made and works great .
5301,i should stick with the one that works for me .
5302,"it s not the cheapest ,  but it s the cheapest good one ."
5303,"i doubt his coat will ever be any thicker ,  regardless of what i use ."
5304,i just don t care for this at all .
5305,i tried one and gave the rest away .
5306,what was most important to me was battery life .
5307,this time the plot is pretty cut and dry .
5308,i got the red ones and num_num which was perfect for me .
5309,which started my quest on researching the in s and outs of the commercial pet food business .
5310,"as mentioned in other reviews ,  this is not for cars and trucks ."
5311,and i m even happier that shipping was free .
5312,i did not like the fit at all .
5313,"like i said it s too expensive for what you re getting ,  worth $ at best ."
5314,meat and vegetables browned on the cast iron skillet taste way better that from the non stick pan .
5315,"i just rinse and wipe ,  along the grain ,  using a sponge ."
5316,included chores should be dancing and assembling the velcro stars in the kit .
5317,"not sure how legit it is ,  but the company has perfect ratings . so anyway ,  this smells musky and dank ."
5318,it makes a great flower vase !  see the customer photo .
5319,"and that was without refrigerating the dough beforehand ,  so i was impressed ."
5320,"as i suspected ,  it is full of artificial ingredients ."
5321,i have been cooking bacon in the microwave for years using a dinner plate and layers of paper towels .
5322,the cars do not work very well especially when small kids are trying to use them .
5323,"great lock for other bikes i suspect ,  but not designed for thick brake disks with smaller holes ."
5324,"like your cellphone ,  this vacuum charges in a dock where it sits and then you can use it ."
5325,everyone needs one of these at some time or another .
5326,eventually i replaced it with a linksys num_extend
5327,i bought this little chopper to replace a hand version .
5328,"the price seems very good ,  and i hope that the card has arrived and works for my son ."

5330,"i love it ,  but it is annoying to have to drag it out when i wanted to use it ."
5331,"you would never know kids ,  grandkids ,  cat and dog lived here ."
5332,i tried it but it wasn t exactly what i was looking for .
5333,this filter not only works for the dust and dirt .
5334,the cutout on the bottom is too small to allow the phone to be pushed up easily .
5335,easy to order my product as it was shipped appropriately as well .
5336,"eh ,  i wish i spent my money elsewhere ."
5337,it came with two inserts and fit my sirrus bike perfectly .
5338,"probably one of the most useful pans ,  you ll find many other uses for it ."
5339,now i use stainless steel and cast iron .
5340,the next one was stolen out of shopping cart at age two days .
5341,"this knife makes short work out of cutting veggies ,  it makes it almost effortless ."
5342,amazon lets them get away with treating people like this and allows them to sell on their site .
5343,it is just a taste preference . you will really like this yogurt maker .
5344,"in fact ,  i would recommend this model to anyone who has pets ."
5345,"it stays on fine ,  but it picks up a lot of background noise ."
5346,the only decent thing about these disposable glasses is the case .
5347,"i have been using it for a week ,  and i don t see visible results as promised  yet ?   ."
5348,i wasn t surprised that the dry roasted edamame tasted like salty dust .
5349,"i fixed my phone this morning ,  and i d like to say that the product seems just fine ."
5350,i ve had mine for a couple of years now and absolutely love it .
5351,i actually would be wary of using this with any screen protectors at all .
5352,"the garlic press ,  for example ,  is so sturdy it ll likely outlive us all ."
5353,"great sound quality ,  comfortability ,  and range for a headset manufactured num_num years ago ."
5354,"the oil filter wasn t on too tight ,  so the cheaper plastic tool worked out just fine for me ."
5355,i followed the lessons in the book and my fondant cakes have improved greatly .
5356,"although paper filters aren t very big ,  you have to imagine them being tossed out by the millions ."
5357,i m giving this bose bt num_num stars because it paired fast and it was comfortable .
5358,"the muffins burned a little on the bottom ,  so next time i ll have to watch them ."
5359,"it is black ,  rubberized armor for your iphone ."
5360,"great handle ,  great weight to the steel ,  and does a solid job honing my chef s knives ."
5361,"the diagrams are small and vague ,  and not intuitive ."
5362,this is easier and cheaper than the single cup brewers and the result is the same .
5363,i have several less expensive units that have diagonal blades and they are close to useless .
5364,everything is in reach and the hooks do not come off when you pull a pan off .
5365,the rope itself was a very low grade inflexible plastic .
5366,this will accomplish all three . it provides wet and dry measures in quantities up to num_num cup .
5367,they provided excellent traction control but bot of the shoe covers broke after num_num uses .
5368,this seems to be a nice skin for my daughters phone .
5369,it does reach now they can torture their mother with whatever music they want to play .
5370,my favorite ice cream so far is caramel chocolate pecan .
5371,however if the seal was not intact i probably received a bottle of water .
5372,i bought this item as it was described as new but it was far from it .
5373,that old cliche applies here .  .  .  . you pay for what you get .
5374,look at the other reviews for helpful hints .
5375,"even worse ,  i realized only after i got it that it s the frame to be used around dioptric lenses ."
5376,"needless to say ,  we went through this pretty fast ."
5377,i have many other wusthof knives in my set and they are truely the best .
5378,second it uses a built in micro usb port for easy charging .
5379,but the controls system is the worst system i ve ever used .
5380,.  .  .  the bold s camera was a surprise to me .
5381,these are by far the best pair of earphones i have used in terms of sound quality and comfort .
5382,"how could i go wrong ?  well ,  you get what you pay for ."
5383,and i was my boards as i use them .
5384,so i was given this by a neighbor and sprayed both her lawn and mine with it .
5385,nice color too !  she says she can recommend it for num_extend users heartily .
5386,"i ve seen other pot racks in this price range that were lightweight and had thin ,  cheap hooks ."
5387,and a templete on where the screws go .
5388,i was pretty disappointed with the lack of peppermint flavor .
5389,rockstar caved into the political and financial pressure and pass the $ dollar loss onto the consumers .
5390,windows xpokipage num_extend printeri replaced a dying computer with one that did not have a parallel port .
5391,it might actually make it a little worse .
5392,"do not buy this unit thinking that you are getting the power of a pressure washer ,  you don t ."
5393,the first thing i learned about this roller is that dough resting is very important .
5394,we go to sea world all the time to see elmo .
5395,my popcorn comes out nice and fluffy and i even make kettle corn this way .
5396,push all three buttons for num_num seconds  they then asked me to return it for replacement .
5397,it has too much cotton in it and not enough polyester or knit .
5398,it does one thing good and that s to charge my num_extend gen ipod nano .
5399,the stock battery would charge from empty in about an hour and a half .
5400,"use wood glue sparingly ,  don t let it drip all over the num_extend"
5401,it is two round prongs which will not plug into anything i have ever seen or used .
5402,just finished a smoked turkey sandwich with dill chips on rye that just came out of my bread machine .
5403,"although the breville does not have a variable heat control ,  i found that to be of no consequence ."
5404,the case is very sturdy and great quality .
5405,"it is solid ,  well made ,  and not too heavy ."
5406,got this for additional opened bottles of wine as the initial kit only comes with num_extend
5407,i would spend more time trying to clean it up .
5408,xl was way too roomy in the bottom .
5409,"for that reason ,  i never wash them in the sink where suds can hide them and risk injury ."
5410,the deodorant goes on smoothly and clear with no residue .
5411,i gave it two stars because the pouch is good .
5412,otherwise they run a bit small in width compared to similar boots .
5413,thanks amazon for theenvironment friendly packaging and quality item .
5414,my kids are big cereal eaters so we don t have any issue with the cereal going stale .
5415,it pops almost every kernel and works with very little oil .
5416,"iriver ,  apparently ,  couldn t find the time to help me ."
5417,what i noticed real quick is that this thing gives ratings all over the place .
5418,i read the previous reviews that said the cans were dented .
5419,i chose this thermometer because it it is inexpensive and it is waterproof  makes it easy to clean  .
5420,the material is real durable and so far i am impressed .
5421,you simply can t ask for a better headset .
5422,"if you need a portable battery ,  this is the one to buy ."
5423,little or no torque but that is probably a good thing so you don t ruin a decent knife .
5424,i m more interested in the game itself . i downloaded and tried the demo for a couple of hours .
5425,i ve had this grinder for six years and it works well .
5426,"the dress is not as pink as in the picture ,  rather a dull color ."
5427,couldn t return it became a deposit for the trash .
5428,"otoh ,  the metal parts go through the dishwasher just fine ."
5429,i love that i can put a regular full size muffin pan in it .
5430,lets just say the excitement was shot lived .
5431,they do take up a lot of cupboard space though !  .
5432,i feel so much better using these rather than plastic containers .
5433,but of course i have no real clue .
5434,"this product is too big for small bread puppies ,  so would recommend a different version for smaller breads ."
5435,it s amazing how much we rely on this .
5436,that s about as much as you are going to get out of it .
5437,update :  i gave the battery another shot before returning and it lasts about num_num hours under normal usage now .
5438,"they re very lightweight cotton ,  and it felt like i wasn t even wearing an undershirt ."
5439,"i found one similar at a large retail store for much less ,  yet still similar quality ."
5440,"there is a strange looking ,  hinged  shower head  that delivers the hot water to the filter basket ."
5441,"i think they are made well ,  and perhaps for a slightly larger ,  younger pet ,  they would probably work fine ."
5442,this iron received thumbs up from the consumer testing world .
5443,evidently because the strips are designed to measure the general hardness of fresh water aquariums only .
5444,i just don t get the hang of it .
5445,yes all the braun ear thermometers are great when it comes to taking a child s temperature .
5446,this one is made of stainless steel and seems to be lighter .
5447,"please be aware this was not an amazon contact ,  this was direct by phone to virbac in texas . wrong ."

5469,my riding buddies are always telling me how noisy it is even after i had recently lubed .
5470,will recommend this to anyone that needs a reliable back up charger .
5471,this means it can accept all kinds of meat in it .
5472,"call me sappy ,  but opening my pantry and seeing these jars is one of life s little pleasures ."
5473,liked it for the few months num_extend i had it .
5474,the heater kept my num_num gallon tank nice and warm but wasn t very consistent .
5475,it doesn t really lengthen the way it claims and certainly does nothing for volume .
5476,although i must admit that my hair is very thick and wiry .
5477,"the only time you can pick a new jersey to wear ,  is when you earn one ."
5478,the shredding and grating disks are much more efficient on the cuisinart though .
5479,i just think there are better quality out there .
5480,"i thought they looked great ,  did the job well ,  weren t expensive and were durable ."
5481,"so ,  the majority of you with shorter hair will likely have different results that i did ."
5482,"i m not sure which brand he wears ,  but it is the same as in this bar ."
5483,just sit back and relax with your power outlet in your bag .
5484,if it was inverted i have no faith that it will retain water .
5485,i got this as a christmas present for my brother .
5486,"use very little water ,  very clean ,  not too hot to handle ."
5487,then if you have to wear eye protectors it s even worse .
5488,the pause and serve feature is definately improved comared to other models .
5489,and he said no he sent me another clear case that didn t fit either .
5490,i use them when driving and at the gym .
5491,she is currently taking homeopathics and is on a raw organic food diet .
5492,"this is a must for anyone who want to can lg amts of fruits ,  veggies or hearty meat dishes ."
5493,when i try to wipe the face of the phone of the lint really sticks to that material .
5494,these are just like other filters but it s nice to order online from amazon .
5495,"yellow squash and zucchini are especially great as are broccoli ,  carrots ! i was careful not to undercook the eggs ."
5496,this is a great gift for the coffee drinker on the run .
5497,"if you buy it ,  give it few days and it will grow on you ."
5498,both bottom pins on the kickstand broke when i opened it at dinner tonight .
5499,so for me the weight wasn t an issue at all .
5500,not enough reasons to upgrade for num_extend owners .
5501,"sometimes ,  it took an overnight soaking in hot water to get out baked on lasagna ."
5502,holds a whole fryer or num_num chops plus sauce .
5503,the reason i bought this bag is that tamrac adventure num_num is too big .
5504,what can i say ?  it s a crust shield .
5505,i got these books along with some disney leapfrog books for my daughters christmas present .
5506,i wouldn t recommend paying that high of a price for it though .
5507,"didn t work for my application ,  might work for others ,  but just didn t have the transmission power i needed ."
5508,i started to get dizzy and extremely tired .
5509,"i could of become a chef ,  but i don t like the hours involved ."
5510,this holster was purchased for a glock num_num gen num_num and does not work well at all .
5511,i grind my own beans pack them lightly in the cup poor in the water and thats it .
5512,i learned this the hard way with my gps suction mounts . i use the car mount all the time .
5513,"the concept is understandable ,  but the purpose is not ."
5514,i like the flat bottom so you can steam such things as fish as well .
5515,tries to load and ends up with  no disc  .
5516,my cookies were no longer crispy and brown on the outside and soft in the middle .  .  . they were baked evenly .
5517,difficult to bite through then it sticks to your teeth . kind of like taffy .
5518,incredible product and so thrilled that i ordered it .
5519,for $ amazon has a great price for this brita pitcher .
5520,"disgusting ,  won t be buying this again ,  what a waste !  ."
5521,the lids fit exactly as tightly as you want them to .
5522,"time after time ,  doing test cuts before and after ,  on the paper towel ,  with each pair ."
5523,i have larger hands which are also strong .
5524,"it s suppose to be good up to num_num degrees ,  but they can catch on fire ."
5525,without any need for any meds for any chronic condition .
5526,i would recommend it if you were looking for a steam cleaner .
5527,i haven t contacted the seller and i don t plan to .
5528,i am impressed with thequality and weight of the piece .
5529,i use this thing all the time to smoke pork butt or grill a chicken or roast .
5530,paying as much as you are i expect to have a full cup from one pod .
5531,the description says the individual egg cups are aluminum with a stainless steel coating and that is wrong .
5532,after shown what was possible with spiderman num_extend this game is a big let down .
5533,i knew this was stoneware when i got it .
5534,we have not seen the groundhog since and my few cabbages left are doing ok .
5535,this is the reason i bought three of them .
5536,"they are not meant to be worn with socks ,  so the inside should be finished better ."
5537,it felt num_num sizes too small in band and cup size .
5538,"it s well made ,  marked properly and  for those that know what they re doing  it seems perfect ."
5539,and i refuse to pay more than $ a piece .
5540,this anolon covered saucepan comes with a lid that has holes to strain liquids and the base has spouts .
5541,"even though it was on sale ,  it was still overpriced in my opinion ."
5542,"i wanted pretty design and a coiled cord ,  so i took a risk with koss ."
5543,you may be one of the lucky ones and get an invicta that works right out of the box .
5544,"i liked this item ,  although it is quite larger than i thought ."
5545,"anyway i ordered some red ,  some black and some blue of these num_num by num_num trays ."
5546,"it has a smooth operation ,  is made of durable stainless steel ,  and cleans easily in the dishwasher ."
5547,kind of a pita but the case comes off pretty easily .
5548,"i don t like the thermometer ,  but that s personal preference ."
5549,"best buy !  i would recommended ,  but would be nice if they improves in their finish touch up side ."

5552,takes forever to charge the phone .  .  . would not recommend it .

5555,the seller has not contacted me but i suspect that they knew they were defective when they obtained them .
5556,"what a disappointment !  i have always trusted the logitech brand ,  but they missed the mark here ."
5557,"my coffee is always piping hot ,  it does perk very quickly and i enjoy using it everyday ."
5558,they are hard to scratch and don t peel off easy .
5559,a very cheaply made undersized piece of junk .
5560,"anyways defender used to be great ,  this just feels cheap ."
5561,"i m just bummed i m out the c batter money ,  nothing else i own takes c s ."
5562,i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else .
5563,it has been working very well for a month .
5564,we went to open the truffles and found a giant lump of a mess .
5565,i have moved it twice to try to get the stench further away from us .
5566,german design   made in china  . it replaces another similar still working but not the same quality .
5567,i make protein waffles and freeze them for a quick breakfast .
5568,"with this model ,  hoover fixed virtually all of the problems ."
5569,"i got this for my husband ,  heloves it ."
5570,"i agree with some of the other reviews ,  this product should be taken off the market ."
5571,"if you re looking for a great line that was developed for really damaged hair ,  try de cinque science ."
5572,"for some reason the phone would not update web based apps like stock market ,  bloomberg and weather ."
5573,the credit card slots are not well made .
5574,top and bottom fit well; just sides did not stay over the edges .
5575,the swivel screen is in the way when making a phone call .
5576,"i read and watched reviews on america s test kitchen ,  they gave it really high ratings ."
5577,it repeatedly forgets whether i m wearing it or not .
5578,you will never regret buying one of their products .
5579,"great while it lasted ,  but doesn t last long at all ."
5580,i guess i won t bother to show her my onion goggles .
5581,"in fact ,  i can talk pretty softly under most circumstances and be heard just fine ."
5582,i would say this is for little kids that do not get frustiated easly .
5583,looking to get num_extend version to hopefully solve this issue .
5584,using with my work iphone num_extend  a well marketed p . o . s .   and no one can hear me .
5585,its not a round product which is part of the problem .
5586,of all the moose items i purchased for our travel trailer .  .  . this just brings a smile to my face .
5587,"however ,  it has one major flaw :  the alarm is very weak ."
5588,you basically just walk forward and hit x every so often .
5589,wow !  how much fun can popping corn be ?  love this and it takes no time at all to pop .
5590,to the point where all my waffles split in half and i have to dig them out .
5591,"in the first place ,  this will not work with the otter box protective case ."
5592,it cost a small fortune to get frontline for everyone and now seems like it was a waste .
5593,the unit is easy to take apart and clean  it really only requires a quick rinse  .

5600,i ve used this product years ago getting it from walmart .
5601,the battery has restored my phone to optimum levels of performance .
5602,"this system never switches off ,  keeps flashing  standby  ."
5603,"they would stay inflated ,  the air would rapidly come out because the fastener wouldn t stay on in the back ."
5604,"the large screen ,  individual numeral buttons ,  and sturdy build make this a very good kitchen timer ."
5605,i would rather the pulp fall into the glass then the seeds .
5606,i ll likely buy a larger stock pot for soups and based on this .
5607,i saw salmon and almond roca in a gopicnic offering and almost died of joy .
5608,"the football ,  as it left the quarterbacks hands traveled right .  .  .  . his hand was throwing to the left ."
5609,plus the temperature rise is only a few degrees indicating good efficiency .
5610,there are two obvious advantages to a stovetop kettle .
5611,the sound is flat and lifeless and the volume controls do nothing .
5612,"the mango is incredibly good ,  too bad there was literally no mango pieces inside ."
5613,no other boards fail you if a member dies !  !  !  ?  ?  ? enemies : pretty much look alike .
5614,my new wallet is so much nicer . i m very happy with my purchase !  .
5615,"before i used to pull and stretch dough ,  now i just roll out the edges ."
5616,i would recommend this to aebleskiver noobs not unlike myself .
5617,it turns out the subnet must be different from the two lines or the router gets confused .
5618,"one the first one ,  the coupling for the hose cracked ."
5619,does anyone else notice this problem ? i also don t really like the plastic gold colored trimmings that separate the shadows .
5620,i love this part of the game and a definite draw to play mem .
5621,the unit heats up quickly and only takes a few minutes to make a waffle .
5622,there are better ones out there that clean your scalp better for the same price .
5623,players are detailed and stadiums are replicated down to the upperdeck chairs .
5624,my only gripe is that i did not know the the screen holes were so big .
5625,i was really looking foward to this and i bought it the first day it came out .
5626,i would not order this shirt in the futere .
5627,it keeps neater when making cheese with yogurt .
5628,would not recommend buying this product until they redesign or make it better .
5629,"other filters i have owned you can either have it on or the radio ,  or forget conversation ."
5630,this may work if you have a very low wattage microwave .
5631,also too many places where the game takes over the characters movement .
5632,i guess they now moved the feature to the more expensive model with the separate monitor .
5633,when i did the search for accessories for my behold ii this head set popped up .
5634,"this is a real lifesaver ,  i was getting splatter everywhere ."
5635,fun colors to choose from to add some pizazz to your kitchen drawer .
5636,"worked out very well ,  and made the job easy ."
5637,"get it amazon  the best price i found  and save a search ,  aggravation ,  a trip and gas !  ."
5638,"i poured half the water out again ,  refilled the bowl at the feeding station and watched ."
5639,i have several red ka products and so i bought this without actually laying hands on it .
5640,the samsung device is not handsfree or eyefree at all .
5641,"it s perfect ,  plus ,  my husband now does most of the cooking !  ."
5642,"the coffee beans were very wet ,  it appeared that they just poured vanilla sugar over the beans before packaging ."
5643,it will save in paper filters being tossed out .
5644,i ve used this charger with multiple phones that have the same connector with no issues .
5645,wish i could just turn off the light . charges my samsung galaxy num_extend just fine . i just ordered a second one .
5646,good quality product that s perfect for fried eggs or omelets .
5647,"we had num_num cooks in a num_num x num_num space ,  no problem ."
5648,but thats what i expected for the price .
5649,i was looking for a case for my phone and saw this in a bundle .
5650,had to use a air compression machine  which they say not to  .
5651,i heard great things about this product and that i give it a try on my newly relaxed hair .
5652,i tried it once and threw the rest out .
5653,i just want to have fun with this game .
5654,screen starts to flicker and then goes completely dark even when there s only a single source .
5655,"of course ,  because it s empires ,  it has no musou mode ,  which is the best part of dw ."
5656,great for a vacation or for temporary living .
5657,i also used this for tamping down strawberries for jam .
5658,"little last minute sales precipitate unplanned purchases ,  and that means more wrapping ,  and ,  what is for christmas dinner ."
5659,there are few small ham fragments throughout and they have the texture of hamburger .
5660,i made my first cup the minute it arrived and enjoyedit .
5661,a beautiful addition to my other lemongrass fiesta dinnerware .
5662,"it works well for that  still noisy ,  tho  ."
5663,"that anything ,  including cars ,  lasts ten years is a small miracle in these days of built in obsolescence ."
5664,the item didn t even come close to fitting properly .
5665,i use them in my room to cook with .
5666,don t know what the deal is with these .
5667,i got better results when i used bedhead wax or design essentials .
5668,we decided to look for a canister vacuum since we had good luck with them in the past .
5669,this coffee grinder is a steal for this price .
5670,i ll quote a tiny bit :    cottonseed oil is  definitely not  ok  .
5671,i would not purchase it again and i certainly wouldn t recommend it to a friend .
5672,"i have to admit that for the price ,  it works really well ."
5673,"it fits in the window ,  the fan is powerful enough and it has a thermostat ."
5674,"it fits snugly ,  looks great ,  covers the buttons  big plus  ,  and isn t so bulky ."
5675,"im not representing any interests ,  just stating my experiences ."
5676,"think cinnamon ,  pumpkin pie ,  spiced apple . if you want to smell like that ,  give it a try ."
5677,these coasters really do drink up the condensation and do not stick to the bottom of your glass .
5678,if you accidently do something wrong such as pack in the coffee tightly then you will be sorry .
5679,the handle is tightened down with a simple knob .
5680,not real loud on med and slow speed but on high a bit loud .
5681,it is difficult to scoop out meat from the shell .
5682,"i guess i thought ,   they don t know what they re talking about  ,  or  it couldn t be that bad  ."
5683,"it is a fantasy medieval war game with mixes of rpg ,  action ,  and tactics thrown in ."
5684,while i was making cookie dough it turned off .
5685,"i have learned that if you buy something good once ,  you will not need to replace it ."
5686,i would really recommend this item if you are one of those who intuitive cookers .
5687,"not too surprisingly ,  this model is still current and the reviews look fantastic . this is my second bread machine ."
5688,one of the windows laptops tries to connect but will not succeed .
5689,boooo samsung !  % of the things you make dont last .
5690,"kind of hard to remove ,  but thats also a good thing ."
5691,"took me some time to get the facts  ,  ."
5692,it taste like chocolate frosting the hazelnut taste is lost .
5693,"vornado fans are expensive ,  but worth the price ."
5694,we don t have an electric fryer of any kind .

5698,i eventually stopped using it altogether and it s collecting dust in my closet .
5699,"after a few experiments and tweaking with the timimg ,  everything i cook in it is perfect ."
5700,these pads are so tight they actually cut off the circulation to his forearm and cause swelling .
5701,for these reasons i am convinced i received a badly constructed fake .
5702,"my daughter wanted a pogo stick soooo bad for her num_num birthday ,  so i purchased this ."
5703,for some reason the insides of this thing just get all messed up when this happens . here is an example .
5704,"goes on nice ,  but didn t see any rejuvination ."
5705,we can have better tea for less money by buying loose tea .
5706,so i not only got the protection but i was also able to use it without the holster .
5707,this does not do a great job of detangling .
5708,"i love their salad dressings and fruit spreads ,  but this is not up to par ."
5709,it turned out much crispier than using paper towels and is easy to clean .
5710,"so ,  i was removed the magnetized sight base and fished my day of hunting ."
5711,haven t dropped one yet but i have owned corelle before so i know what to expect .
5712,"as a wood worker ,  drawing circles is a common problem ."
5713,i m really hoping num_num is a great game .  .  . or at least decent .
5714,"there is loading time ,  but it s not annoyingly slow ."
5715,current valves are very lightweight and not suitable for commercial use .
5716,if anything this thing made my makeup concentrate on certain areas even after much blending .
5717,i did a lot of dying the few attempts i made at the last express .
5718,i have to completely alter my initial review .
5719,the shirt is great in length but it s way too tight .
5720,"because it s strapped so tight ,  i have actually got a bruise when i did bicep curls ."
5721,the handle is comfortable to hold and the blade has kept its edge .
5722,i wanted to like it as i have heard so many good things about it .
5723,i bought this for my husband and he did not like it at all .
5724,as a result most people end up looking much the same with a real bad wadrobe case .
5725,the heart dies extremely fast and the actual dog is made out of really low end materials .
5726,"i got the num_extend as a warranty replacement for the defective num_extend according to koss ,  same class replacement ."
5727,he freaked out when i put him on it .
5728,"very poor customer focus ,  not up to the normal amazon excellent customer focus ."
5729,"the third one was less crooked ,  but still wonky ,  and none of them had a decent braze ."
5730,"it s a design flaw ,  and makes the keyboard wholly unusable ."
5731,i wanted something to wash my back that was a little bit of a scrubbing cloth .
5732,will give to someone who this may fit .
5733,i recommend this to anyone looking for a mini to micro usb adapter .
5734,totally useless to me and a complete waste of money .
5735,"like silent hill there are many secrets in the game ,  but you won t care about these ."
5736,from time to time it will tip over in winds num_extend despite the air vents .
5737,my one dog runs away from it when it is rolled near him .
5738,"plus ,  the sealer works on my seal a meal ."
5739,i think this is pretty typical of vacuums like this though .
5740,i also love the voice answer and decline .
5741,"however ,  neither windows update nor the usrobotics site have drivers for it ."
5742,i previously used the more expensive num_extend from target .
5743,i have only had them since september num_extend would recommend this product to anyone wanted additional storage .
5744,"after seeing this illustrated on tv ,  i really wanted to buy one ."
5745,"also ,  the instruction book is really good ,  and the recipes work !  this little baby is a winner ."
5746,i ordered these because i m one of those folks that doesn t like chocolate .
5747,when i saw all those chocolate chunks in back to natures granola i got a little too excited .
5748,"as metioned ,  the spring tension seems minimal and is apparently not up to the task ."
5749,great for charging the phone and extra battery at the same time .
5750,"while i was jumping ,  one side of the cord snapped and almost hit someone at the gym ."
5751,"overall ,  there is not that much for this system ."
5752,the jabra num_extend bluetooth stereo headset is a fantastic headset .
5753,i bought this for my num_num year old for christmas and he loved it .
5754,"i love this pot ,  i use it more than any other ."
5755,"when i asked if i could test it ,  they brought over a wood block ,  a potato ,  and a tomato ."
5756,it s almost painful to see a game with this much potential fail so miserably .
5757,"the car charger seems to work okay ,  so i m good with that too ."
5758,it is a very useful device that should last .
5759,"of course ,  i had to replace the batteries after i d been spraying for about three minutes ."
5760,it s comfortable enough that i sometimes forget i m wearing it .
5761,i bought this dock to charge and hear music and wow it s great .
5762,"couldn t purchase replacement belts locally ,  so had to order them online ."
5763,"dissolve the sugar in a little water first ,  then add to the cream in the isi ."
5764,"and they don t register new recording index marks . previously ,  i had used maxell and never had problems ."
5765,"since those things don t affect the work the vacuum does ,  i am quite happy with my purchase ."
5766,"yet poor design decisions and sloppy controls has made stuntman much ,  much harder than it needs to be ."
5767,that s how beef jerky is supposed to be .
5768,for some reason this pair of keen shoes seemed wider than the ones i have .
5769,i bought this to charge the multiple batteries i have .
5770,paring knife logo is smaller and placed differently on the blade .
5771,"i m in my early num_extend and have delicate ,  fair skin with cool undertones and no real bad issues ."
5772,everything you will love in espresso will be in this .
5773,the kids all wanted to do it for me but i got in some of the fun for myself .
5774,the num_num quart artisan num_num volt model being reviewed here is no exception .
5775,mixer was able to run on one speed only .
5776,"i own a yellow ultrasonic bark control device that is shaped like a gun ,  and that one works ."
5777,well that s only one batch out of num_extend are not organic .
5778,so much better then all the expensive cappuccino machines we previously had .
5779,"definite buy !  these work great with my dehydrator and easy to clean ,  store and use ."
5780,it is smooth once you add the protector .
5781,mind your knuckles though and keep a sturdy box grater on hand for bigger jobs .
5782,i would recommend this item to anyone that is looking for these qualities .
5783,it takes some practice to snap it into its charger .
5784,you will have no way to attach it to your car .
5785,you can make something better  and cheaper  from worn stockings !  !  !  .
5786,"so ,  i just got this yesterday and was all jazzed about it ."
5787,you ll spend a lot of time standing around waiting for stuff to happen .
5788,the grind settings are reliable and produce uniform results a very attractive feature is the lack of mess .
5789,"it stayed there for awhile ,  so i decided to adjust it ."
5790,"i noticed standing water adjacent to the kettle ,  this was at about num_num months ."
5791,"not with the dyson ,  it does it all equally well ."
5792,one must deal with the core and the rind before you get to the luscious fruit .
5793,bought this game and returned it the next day .
5794,"i did as the directions call for  three  ,  not enough fizz ."
5795,just remember that this is a toaster oven and is not really for baking a cake .
5796,when i called verizon i was told that it was activated to another customer .
5797,my daughter needed a phone case she can put on her belt so that she won t lose this phone .
5798,we are a gadget heavy family and we really like these battery packs for charging on the go .
5799,"the grinder is small ,  does not take up very much counter space ,  relatively quiet and quite powerful ."
5800,one warning is that many of these recipes use raw eggs .
5801,this is only true if you intend to leave the battery pack attached full time to your phone .
5802,the controls worked fine also to skip songs .
5803,"remains sharp after countless potatoes ,  apples ,  carrots ,  and what have you skinned ."
5804,this is not an led light and the  light  is not at the end of the little tube .
5805,"i think for kids that can actually hold a crayon or marker ,  these are frustrating ."
5806,"also ,  it just looks fantastic out on the counter ."
5807,"farewell ,  old salt .  .  . b  it sucks making tapes ,  however ."
5808,this coat rack lasted around num_num years until one of the base legs splintered off the column .
5809,it wasn t able to handle the weight of two large bags of the same size .
5810,anything that effectively organizes your materials pays for itself .
5811,only exceptions are the heavy soap residue and minerals which i still need to use elbow grease and cleaner .
5812,only drawback is the protruding points in the bottom which make cleaning more difficult .
5813,"i like it better than the ones where the center can be removed ,  because the centers never stay in ."
5814,"but on a good note ,  i love num_num pink ,  it is my favorite ."
5815,non of this over the shoulder stuff does it for me .
5816,i agree with another poster; the handle could be about an inch longer .
5817,"well unfortunately ,  it didnt really do much for me ."
5818,"as far as the mini games ,  only the safe guess is even close to kinda fun ."
5819,i loved the idea of this thermometer and was tickled to get it so much below retail price .
5820,i canceled the call manually on my phone screen .
5821,the texture is good but the quality is bad .
5822,at this point the phone doesn t make any sound .
5823,"also ,  don t use the handle to tighten the  pot  down ."
5824,"or i can finish the chrust with out cooking the cheese anymore ,  if i want a more crisp crust ."
5825,i contacted petsafe to ask about the possibility that they will carry us made refills .
5826,the screen is the same size as a samsung galaxy num_extend
5827,i m mostly pleased and will keep using it .
5828,they literally gave me a broken defective charger .
5829,"unless this stuff performs some sort of miracle ,  i don t think i will be purchasing again ."
5830,coffee s before but got tired of having to replace them every year or so .
5831,she s num_num yrs old and i thought the glucosamine would be beneficial to her .
5832,my only complaint is that it kind of smells for a few days .
5833,i love this headset for calls and if you aren t moving around too much .
5834,i ve tried this armband while working out at the gym .
5835,"it was binding on itself ,  would spit out too much line and get twisted up ."
5836,my husband s coffee stays tasting just fine and stays nice and hot for the entire day .
5837,once you uncap the bottle and put the brush in it you re on borrowed time .
5838,they aren t sexy but they work a thousand times better because they are hard plastic .
5839,on top of that it was on sale .
5840,it s an achilles heel for what would be a great speaker set .
5841,its like the developers spent more money on the cutscenes then the actual game .
5842,"if you want to use a screwdriver every time you wash your lid ,  this is the mug for you ."
5843,"i didn t even bother returning it ,  but would certainly not buy again ."
5844,i just finished my bottle of this stuff and saw no difference in my hair .
5845,"this bluetooth actualy worked fine ,  but would not stay placed properly on my ears when i moved around ."
5846,my entire living room reeks of dog urine now .
5847,there is also no reset button to return to factory defaults .
5848,it is not designed to take this kind of recoil and it will damage the scope .
5849,"i learned that you should only use liquid detergent with no scents ,  esp those that are citrus based ."
5850,"when you hit an enemy ,  your character will walk up and lightly swing their sword ."
5851,"because the handle puts together in pieces ,  we left one out for my small niece to use ."
5852,it is definitely a good value for the price .
5853,"i agree with other reviewers that if you love vanilla fragrances ,  you can t get better than this ."
5854,"unpleasant aftertaste ,  i bought this hoping i would enjoy it ."
5855,i really like this product and the ease of popping corn .
5856,kinda disappointed so just ought one from the apple store .
5857,"with feathers and mouse tails ,  those toys actually make sense and bring out the hunter insticts in cats ."
5858,both times they lasted about num_num months before they stopped working .
5859,"most of the time it isn t the enemy killing you ,  its the camera ."
5860,"and falling asleep !  and waiting some more ,  until your boat arrives to your destination ."
5861,that slight bump is supposed to secure it from unscrewing .
5862,the height seems to play against the sturdiness of it as well .
5863,it is also very easy to take out when the phone rings .
5864,i also use the steamer to cook salmon and other fish for my husband and it comes out perfect .
5865,everyone is different though and reacts differently to a product .
5866,these cut off the circulation to your fingers .
5867,i also don t believe that it was protective to my hair at all .
5868,"nothing as i remember dutch licorice .  .  . not salty taste ,  just ammonium chloride ,  nor salt crystals on licorice ."
5869,i think they do not like it because it is shredded .
5870,"to many bad cincy drivers to not pay attention all the time . easy to use ,  easy to set up ,  wifi ."
5871,"if you liked all the gauntlet games ,  this is for you ."
5872,the arms and legs are three times as wide as my body .
5873,comfortable and they let me get rid of that stupid ear loop .
5874,this is a professional unit with num_num peak amps .
5875,i couldn t get the medium over my thighs !  order large .
5876,"i have one of these ,  and have used it for years ."
5877,this carpet cleaner took all of the stains out .
5878,"we also put screenguardz on both of our droids ,  so now they are protected num_num degrees ."
5879,i got a new pup and the washable pads stayed in place .
5880,also they were odd shaped like the plastic was too small fro the pad .
5881,coffee is still warm the next day !  and sometimes i will drink it .
5882,this perfectly portable usb micro cord is num_num inches from end to end when fully extended .
5883,"i liked the first one better ,  this one seems a bit on the cheap side ."
5884,"water gets exteremely hot ,  which is great for making strong tea ."
5885,"also ,  if you are not a cook ,  you will not like this crock ."
5886,downloads contacts  not normal  streams music to system etc .
5887,be careful when you squeeze the clip to put it on .
5888,"since newer reviews seemed generally positive ,  i thought i would take a shot ."
5889,i will keep it only because it is a pain to return .
5890,i was hoping this would work for me but did not .
5891,but here to the rescue was my corelle living ware platter .
5892,i didn t bother with the adapters; they look finicky .
5893,i have a red one exactly like this and i loved it also .
5894,kitchenaid ssa sausage stuffer kit attachment for food grinderthis product works very well; a very basic product .
5895,item had wonderful reviews but my gravity fed aquarium siphon does a better job .
5896,"neither the whites nor yolks were completely hard ,  which is what i was looking for ."
5897,"however ,  i have a mild allergy to soy and this does contain soy ."
5898,"mine is a bit too snug ,  although it fits ."
5899,not much else fits next to this one when we are cooking a lot of food .
5900,"ritz didn t make a new innovative product ,  they took their same lousy recipe and changed the way it looks ."
5901,it works right out of the box with my iphone num_extend and ipod nano num_extend generation .
5902,"they are fairly inflexible ,  and that makes it harder to put those shaker lids on and take them off ."
5903,"yes ,  they take up space ,  but you can put things in them ."
5904,"you can t pin a broken chinchilla leg ,  so that means an amputation ."
5905,it doesn t hold as much as i like but it keeps them contained .
5906,it works well for an elderly relative in assisted living .
5907,"i left it in for hours ,  like about num_extend"
5908,"that way ,  the song name and author ,  etc .  ,  is saved with the song ."
5909,"it did ,  however ,  have a significant amount of sugars in it ."
5910,i paid num_num for them before they were on sale .
5911,at this date amazon shows this out of stock .
5912,"for that reason ,  i would say it s not worth the time or money ."
5913,"after about three colossi ,  i was bored to death ."
5914,"i hear and sound better with these than any other set i ve had ,  and i ve had a few  :   ."
5915,the good part is that you can move the legs left and right so they don t affect any buttons .
5916,the basket rotating actually fries food more evenly and definitely faster .
5917,it is great for the beach because it keeps water and sand off .
5918,but i cannot play this on my windows xp or num_num pc s .
5919,but i would be interested in a pancake maker along the same lines .
5920,"when that box inside breaks ,  there are a lot of sharp metal and plastic pieces ."
5921,turns out it is made of cheap cast metal which was weak .
5922,the one and only redeeming feature is the price .
5923,this is a lot better than i expected .
5924,it is reading a good num_num degrees lower than actual temps in the num_num to num_num range .
5925,"when the stinkis there ,  it stays on your hands too ."
5926,"i own the chocolate flavor and think it s pretty good ,  but i just do not like the vanilla ."
5927,i received some pretty nasty splinters just pulling it out of the box .
5928,oxo good grips stainless steel measuring cups come in a set of four .
5929,he had them out of the fire plug in a matter of minutes .
5930,just have to get used to using it . it always connects just fine to my iphone .
5931,i would not want to see anyone else s child go through what mine did .
5932,"i don t seem to have any problems with shoes ,  other than my sperry loafers . i started using sneaker balls ."
5933,i know this is to be expected with a nonadjustable cheap sharpener .
5934,unlike some other reviewers i had no problem sealing the jars .
5935,a trashpile like this doesn t even deserve the bargain bin .
5936,at $ there are better bags out there .
5937,it only amplifies what signal you already have .   i noticed immediate improvement .
5938,i read the amazon reviews of the towels and made note of the occasional complaint about them shedding lint .
5939,it is of solid construction and doesn t feel cheap .
5940,it is not an exaggeration to say that this plan will last a lifetime .
5941,"once i received it ,  i knew it wasn t something for me ."
5942,"i have very long ,  thick hair and it was difficult to get the ends to curl ."
5943,"by default vox is disabled ,  so you have to initiate an intercom connection manually ."
5944,"after that ,  i had no problems with sticking ."
5945,i m glad i did !  wonderful knife for brownies and others .
5946,but the second says that it is a  healthy alternative  to processed sugar . this isn t true at all .
5947,this is the only reason i chose this seller because i thought it would get here faster .
5948,"i was hesitant to buy this ,  but after using it i m glad i did ."
5949,"wow ,  who knew there were so many honey jars out there ."
5950,"bore sight it ,  correct it ,  shoot a one hole group at num_num yards ."
5951,i did yet another exchange and the new one is working for the moment .
5952,i would also recommend getting other pots by this brand .
5953,i don t have to constantly repeat myself as with the non boom variety of bluetooth devices .
5954,"wish they would bring it back !  great for acne prone skin ,  not oily ,  goes on smooth ."
5955,"either way ,  it s frustrating and i hate it ."
5956,inside industry joke i m sure .  .  . my recommendation ?  move south if you can afford it .
5957,i ended up throwing it in the trash after awhile and purchasing a ninja blender .
5958,it s also a really nice size to bring your lunch to work in .
5959,"it can break ,  so avoid stress on that area ."
5960,so it is advisable that you research which bluetooth headset works better for your use and your smartphone .
5961,"i like braun products generally ,  but this is a dud ."
5962,i own a few of these and could not cook or serve without them .
5963,i recommend it for a casual or active cook who values a good utensil .
5964,this is crazy !  this is an rpg we re playing here .
5965,i hooked it back up to the charger and left it for another num_num hours .
5966,"first off ,  the part number is not the same as the original oem battery ."
5967,i have hardwood floor and it just goes right over them with great suction .
5968,"like most everyone else ,  my son s mower doesn t blow bubbles either ."
5969,sadly i have sprint as my mobile phone provider and they have dreadful coverage in the greater seattle area .
5970,it fit perfectly on my phone .  .  . so perfect that it seems like the phone came like this .
5971,i d buy it again and i d use the oem shop for other needs as well .
5972,i wanted an inexpensive sonicare but the brushing is so extreme that it pushed back my lower gum .
5973,i mean it should not have changed my nice phone pink .
5974,seems to secure pretty well and i m happy with the product so far .
5975,"interestingly ,  konica minolta does recommend a print server for my printer ,  the  seh num_extend usb pocket print server  ."
5976,"the old school  shove others out of the way ,  my car s invincible  gag . maybe it s just me ."
5977,it looks great in the dark as well .
5978,stay away from these lux timers unless you want onlyyour dog to hear it !  .
5979,"this portable battery is about the same size of a deck of cards ,  but almost twice as thick ."
5980,"it was sent in a med size box ,  with other items in the box ."
5981,"i sweat easily ,  and do a lot of biking and walking ,  and my work is somewhat physical too ."
5982,i literally will not buy any other charging products except from new trent .
5983,"if you do ,  making this pin fit is simple ."
5984,"i finally added a set of num_num of these rim pasta bowls in tangerine ,  and i love them ."
5985,i think a finely ground coffee would do the same thing .
5986,i don t like the taste at all and will not be using it as a supplement .
5987,this pan turns out a very nice size cheesecake for entertaining .
5988,"not only so you don t burn yourself ,  but it will open up much easier as well ."
5989,there is a rocker volume switch on the top and a large call receiving button on the side .
5990,"i like these covers ,  but they are very very bulky ."
5991,"to me ,  the weight and size and function are most important ."
5992,when i opened it up it looked like the oem cable except for there were some slight differences .
5993,i took this  gentle  poison and got terribly sick .
5994,no food had dropped for the entire day !  !  !  !  .
5995,tried to install this on my mother s rollator .
5996,"works ok ,  but anytime my ac kicks in ,  this thing makes my tv flicker ."
5997,"next ,  the taste :  it tasted like the smell ,  only sweet ."
5998,it does not do anything for your eyes .
5999,wanted to replace an existing revere ware kettle but this one is smaller than the one we have .
6000,the first unit i received had some manufacturing quality issues .
6001,"i am actively looking for friends that i can give this pot to ,  to spread the good news ."
6002,i found that to be a big improvement over this game .
6003,"this is a perfect ,  indispensable tool in the kitchen ."
6004,this unit is solid and nice light with good price .
6005,item received today and right on the label it says made in india in all caps .

6011,both of them are leaking when closed and filled with water .
6012,"the bowl and beaters are easy to clean ,  and the mixer itself wipes down nicely ."
6013,the cooking surface is quite large and the pan itself is quite sturdy .
6014,if you need a cookie sheet i recommend this one .
6015,it takes me only num_num minutes to put together by myself .
6016,all you need to know is that mine broke the first time i used it .
6017,"however ,  it does not cover enough square footage ."
6018,nowhere does it say that certain parts are not covered .
6019,"however ,  it s not waterproof ,  and smears when it gets moist  eye drops ,  tears ,  etc .  .  .   ,  weird ."
6020,"this is fine with me . overall ,  too many problems for me ."
6021,the pot arrived yesterday and i seasoned it  based on others  comments  .
6022,but not enough to knock off a star . great versatile presentation piece at a great price .
6023,they charge all the devices and material is of good quality .
6024,"nearly half the price of a kitchenaid mixer ,  but with a more powerful motor ."
6025,it s nice and sturdy and i m sure it will stand the test of time .
6026,i love to have a dinner party with a cake in this case .
6027,the condition of your darts will deteriorate quickly using the clips anyhow .
6028,the battery charger part does not come with a battery .
6029,"it s impossible not to feel sorry for him ,  to not somewhat sympathize with him ."
6030,upon examination somehow the ink they used on the bottle was running and getting into the bottle .
6031,sounded bad ha  the only thing that i encountered was the picture looks two toned .
6032,"additionally ,  volume is easily regulated . pairing with the motorola num_extend phone was quick and easy ."
6033,i just think they are a bit high on the pricing .
6034,my havanese had it torn apart in less than num_num minutes with stuffing all over the floor .
6035,you could even put lotion on a cotton ball and it would work just as well .
6036,i m not having any issues with the lid as others are describing .
6037,it charges my motorola droid without any problems .
6038,it s nice and large i can prepare meals for the whole family at once .
6039,"second ,  when pouring water or coffee ,  there are no side spills or dripping ."
6040,"i ve always thought wilton products to be above average quality ,  but i m learning differently .  .  .  . it was a costly lesson ."
6041,i just need the chlorine and other minor contaminates removed .
6042,this is the best price on these tablets i have found .
6043,"you turn it on ,  it starts spinning intermittently just like it s supposed to ."
6044,i am afraid to even use it now because it might just get much worse .
6045,"picture shows various colors ,  yet you cannot choose a color ."
6046,the blue light isn t as bothersome as i thought it would be .
6047,they offered a pair of smartbuds free with the order .
6048,nice if company did more for quality control .
6049,i own all duke nukem games and this is the worst .
6050,this flour does provide the herbs and spices taste of kentucky fried chicken .
6051,i am happy they have the lip to keep from spill overs .
6052,"however ,  the other features of this mount are useful enough to buy it ."
6053,this is a great looking set of dinnerware and i m impressed with its durability .
6054,the only possible negative to this item is its weight .
6055,first let me say that this is a fun game .
6056,i ve inspected both blenders and cannot find one blemish on them .
6057,this is more for teacup size dogs and not for small dogs .
6058,"well built ,  fits snugly and does the job as advertised ."
6059,"if kitchen space is a consideration ,  this may be a hassle until you figure out a new storage option ."
6060,i will toss this out and buy a more natural product .
6061,"to my shocked surprise ,  the phone was in perfect condition !  not a scratch or dent ."
6062,"i m going back to blue buffalo walnut litter or precious cat ,  but will never try this litter again ."
6063,that s another big fault that this game has when you compare it to other adventure games .
6064,it was also very difficult to plug the adapter into the transmitter .
6065,"i tried to give them away ,  but they didn t fit anybodies droids either ."
6066,i payed $ for my pitcher and it arrived in two days .
6067,the drip tray is great and easy to clean along with the grill .
6068,sure its low in sugar and high in decent protein .
6069,"you just chop up large chunks ,  and drop in and puch button and done ."
6070,"really couldn t stand the taste of this ,  very bitter and didn t taste sweet at all ."
6071,"this thing is a dust trap ,  so no matter what it will eventually go sideways after a while ."
6072,"i ordered one ,  liked it so well ,  i bought another ."
6073,the rapeseed oil producers had tons of oil but no one to sell it to .
6074,the only problem i have is that it will not take bills .
6075,the screen and speaker are better than any other mobile device num_extend emaill .
6076,"and it is ! easy to use ,  perfect for the task ,  and very easy to clean ."
6077,i will be throwing them all in the garbage .
6078,i don t use the email part of it .
6079,i don t understand all the hype about tivoli radios .
6080,"i ll admit ,  the game can be a little fun at times ."
6081,"i have used the original powerstep inserts with much success ,  so thought these would be even better :  wrong ."
6082,i would imagine it would be great for making carrot salad too .
6083,even the otherwise crappy motorola razr line  e . g .
6084,"thought this thermometer would last longer than the regular glass thermometer ,  however ,  it stopped working at num_num degrees ."
6085,i need to find a new source of tendon chews for my num_num small dogs num_extend lbs .
6086,but i noticed some num_extend speaker cables don t fully insert and connect when i have the cover on .

6088,i ended up buying the rs num_num off amazon and am very happy with the around ear design .
6089,i bought this ap to bridge to the belkin pre n router which i like alot .
6090,"when i put this in the bath ,  it had a strong soapy smell but no lavender scent ."
6091,this was the best christmas present i could have gotten for her .
6092,i even use them roll out biscuit dough and to knead bread on .
6093,"i think it would be very difficult to break this ,  the plastic is very thick and durable ."
6094,have used it on a num_num trip on bumpy roads and the phone doesn t move .
6095,"the machine is noisy ,  but the grounds are consistent ,  as expected in a burr machine ."
6096,some of them are always upside down or sideways .
6097,the main problem is the patterning on the handle .
6098,"this does not happen with my foundation alone ,  so i guess it is the fault of this primer ."
6099,nothing fancy just a charger that does what its ment to do .
6100,"like many of you ,  i ve struggled to find a good car mount for phone ."
6101,"the long handle is very easy to use ,  and the pan and lid both feel very solid ."
6102,i love soft gel cases for this reason .
6103,"it could just be me ,  but i had a hard time keeping this thing connected to my wireless router ."
6104,my searches for a portable wireless speaker showed only very expensive items until i came across this spracht .
6105,seemed like too much trouble to ship back a num_num dollar item .
6106,they seem to promote emergencies of inconvenience versus medical emergencies .
6107,"great !  !  it is easy to clean ,  makes great chicken ,  but really large to store ."
6108,it is not that really functional apart from shielding off the stream .
6109,not very often a product that is this good can be found anymore .
6110,"whenever this one wears out ,  we ll happily buy another ."
6111,i nolonger have to sit next to an outlet just to charge my phone .
6112,they are made of fiberboard with a nice low luster black finish .
6113,it heats up your food in minutes with nice convectional feature .
6114,"the knife is clearly very well made ,  and the two blades work very well ."
6115,i wrote htc several times and they always came back with these outlandish  troubleshooting  processes .
6116,and the assortment of additional pieces available is great .
6117,my mom bought this toy foor my son for christmas last year num_extend
6118,"this game is so stupid ,  i don t understand why people like it ."
6119,"also ,  i have one of those covers that clip the front and back together ."
6120,"i think we re using less butter ,  too ,  without even realizing it ."
6121,what have they done to you d !  ?  this game had so much potential .
6122,"all these years ,  my fear of undercooked pork led me to way overcook it ."
6123,this bag alone is heavy and simply does not offer enough padding and does not hold its form well .
6124,they are made of high quality materials and not  flimsy  at all .
6125,"you are ,  after all ,  sticking it in your ear . i love this product ."
6126,i ve ordered a total of num_num of these cases .
6127,"the watch itself is perfect ,  but the strap is useless ."
6128,"the price is right ,  however ,  for a backup case ."
6129,"you want the battery with the  a  at the end ,  not a  u  in the part number ."
6130,it defeats the purpose if the only device this works on is my phone .
6131,"while i recently stopped drinking coffee ,  i will be using this to grind wheat berries into flour ."
6132,"if it was accurate ,  we never would have gone in to the er ."
6133,friends who have seen us use this brush always want one so i give them as gifts .
6134,"i have some gripes about it s size and lack of collapsibility ,  but overall i m glad i have it ."
6135,"whenever i flip the power switch on ,  my droid pairs within num_num seconds ."
6136,the arm is also very solid so it doesn t jiggle around when i m driving .
6137,i do not know how it happened but this is over all cheap .
6138,black of course with a chrome bezel around the front .
6139,have had this thing for months and overall am not pleased with it .
6140,i didn t mess anything up and everything worked as it should .
6141,we love this little machine and so do our guests .
6142,"if you look away with a sharp knife you ll be minus a finger ,  too  ."
6143,we didn t have any issues putting it together and didn t have any leaking .
6144,bought this cause i love pink !  it s cute and does its job .
6145,keep in mind one perosn uses a metal spoon to stir their eggs once and the pan is trashed .
6146,so you have to get the cord just right to have both speakers working .
6147,"it s hard to use ,  hard to reach points on your body ."
6148,tdc direct is quick to offer solutions and send out replacements if you are unhappy with their product .
6149,"it s hefty ,  so i make sure i have it in a steady grip before i pick it up ."
6150,generally i don t pan a product but tested this on two phones .
6151,about half of these dvd s were bad and would not record to them .
6152,the quality on these was a little disappointing as well .
6153,the repairman asked me what types of animals i had .
6154,i was able to fix this before i closed the distance .
6155,i ordered these stamps for my grandchildren to use when they come over .
6156,"these worked well the first couple of times i wore them ,  but unfortunately the waist stretched out ."
6157,the ice cools down the hot liquid and the pitcher will not warp .
6158,sometimes things just work and this does just that .
6159,cleaning stainless liners is a pain as coffee stains and the after taste buildup happens fast .
6160,this kit includes everything you could want to decently decorate a cake .
6161,"bought one ,  then another ,  and another ,  and gave them as gifts ."
6162,i spoke with mike who asked for the name of the person that emailed me the label .
6163,"returned for a full refund ,  amazon made it right ,  ."
6164,i can t recommend if you have sensitive skin .
6165,i like the fact that this unit does not lose readings when power is lost .
6166,"no ,  my hearing isn t bad and i don t wear a hearing aide ."
6167,buy our own cut of meat to limit the fat .
6168,waaaaaaaay worth the $ i paid for these .
6169,after opening the box i was impressed with the weight of the pieces .
6170,a large pancake on top of a smaller pancake . these are like two quarters thick and tall .
6171,it gets the job done !  num_num out of num_num for me .
6172,"after all ,  i am quite satisfied with this product ."
6173,one end is plugged into a computer that sits on the other side of the desk .
6174,"i would not recommend this for any shooter ,  not even an air softer ."
6175,"you will most like skip on this product; or ,  any sunscreen product containing the mentioned toxin ."
6176,"now ,  num_num star for unacceptable ,  barely edible ,  food product ."
6177,took this num_num to help with the stress of the other one not helping at all .
6178,eventually the valve broke and it s obvious why .
6179,this is by far the best roaster i have found for a reasonable price .
6180,this case protects the phone really well but the white doesn t stay white for long .
6181,they are very nice for otherwise messey informal food .
6182,i originally bought this for the shredding aspect but found myself using it as a mandoline more .
6183,i wouldn t touch this product even if it was free .
6184,the only good thing about this cleaner is that the shipping was free .
6185,"however ,  it was in an  unmarked white box  that merely said made in china ."
6186,tightening while pressing against the edge of that sheet metal actually hurts .
6187,"i got this for my ipad ,  and it folds up and comes with a case ."
6188,she was annoyed the  immediate cup of coffee  feature on the original broke and sent it back for replacement .
6189,my only conclusion was the num_extend foot elevation had something to do with how well the eggs cook .
6190,i use it to hold my glasses in my car and it never lets go of them .
6191,"i was extremely pleased with my new battery and cover ,  i received alot more hours of battery life ."
6192,i love it !  when not in uses i leave it in the bottom of oven .
6193,this protector fits well and looks good on the phone .
6194,it grinds for num_num seconds no matter what you put in it !  it s no wonder the coffee sucks .
6195,this is used for a very specific situation :  to use landline equipment with cell phone service .
6196,"with gently use ,  i look forward to using it for years to come ."
6197,perhaps a two pound mason s hammer would do the trick .
6198,"the first day of having it ,  it was perfect ."
6199,this is best screen protector i have found .
6200,if you plan on using wireless devices near this product i would not recommend it .
6201,the story is actually not bad; although it reeks of clint eastwood s hang `em high .
6202,"the filling does not taste like pumpkin !  it tastes sugary but ,  not particularly like anything else ."
6203,i filled the cup about two thirds full and started the machine .
6204,the classic num_num inch cleaver belongs in any serious set of home or professional cutlery .
6205,and i m just not crazy about eating glycerine and you can definitely notice it .
6206,"i am a pretty small female ,  and to me ,  is heavy ,  heavy ,  heavy ."
6207,the box is thick with a very nice insert to help you organize the cards .
6208,although it may be jsut what someone else is looking for .
6209,it could work for you as different curly solutions do different things for people .
6210,i wished i had this scoops this past holidaycookie baking season .
6211,"of course ,  there is a design weakness in these speakers ,  probably worthy of a class action suit against klipsch ."
6212,"now that i use it daily ,  it s even easier to maintain ."
6213,yummy !  i prefer pioneer brand baking mix which i ve purchased at my local superstore  neighborhood market  .
6214,these headphone were the thing i was looking to .
6215,i did give two stars because they truly don t wrinkle which is immensely helpful .
6216,"i m not a fan of the carcinogen vocs in plastics ,  glass will always be the smart alternative for me ."
6217,"maybelline ,  if you re reading this ,  bring back great lash dark brown waterproof mascara !  !  !  it was an excellent product ."
6218,"i could barely taste the coconut and it had a really weird ,  gritty texture that i didn t like ."
6219,"i ve tried all types of grind size ,  i get a few particles through and that s it ."
6220,this machine completely obliterated all stains on the carpet .
6221,anyone who buys it will be happy with it .
6222,i ve tried everything i can get my hands on to kill out this nest .
6223,the game is riddled with bugs and crashes .
6224,i have owned this machine for nearly num_num months now .
6225,"the blades are very thick ,  long ,  and blunt ,  no sharp edges ."
6226,so far this bag has worked out very well .
6227,it has light scent but there is a definitely smell to it .
6228,it s just up and down and up and down .
6229,you can buy commercial products made for that purpose .
6230,"i like to have a pot of coffee for guests ,  etc ."
6231,my only complaint is the ear look is of very poor design .
6232,"for example ,  none will hold a power supply with cable ."
6233,also note that flexogen is a patented hose .
6234,some people even draw the shape of the phone on the paper and place the screws accordingly .
6235,"the pillow is a little too high ,  but it s alright ."
6236,this can opener is the smoothest manual can opener i have ever used .
6237,"standing tall ,  it s really standing tall . battery is pretty good ."
6238,the sides buckle when i walk which also creates cracks in the shoe .
6239,"oh boy ,  what a joy ! this salton is light in weight ,  compact in design ,  and cute ."
6240,"without a doubt this model is an economically priced ,  good piece of bluetooth gear ."
6241,i am a loyal customer . update :  amazon online customer service was flawless .
6242,i also took off the holder piece first and just dealt with the attachment to the air vent .
6243,i had tried another brand and it was not useable at all .
6244,i found that it just wouldn t grind very well and was difficult to push through the grinder .
6245,i wear mine everyday and almost all day .
6246,took me about an hour to swap out the screen on an iphone for a friend .
6247,you don t have a choice to the heat settings .
6248,the pocket is nice and can certainly hold a few credit cards etc .
6249,"when dealing with something of that nature ,  finding a single and complete remedy is very difficult to accomplish ."
6250,seems like they are being made in multiple overseas sweet shops with little quality control .
6251,"in my house ,  after one use ,  the filter is a real mess and must be cleaned throughly ."
6252,"but it wasn t cheap ,  so i really may go through ll the trouble !  ."
6253,what do i do in the mean time for my wake up aid ?  .
6254,"also ,  it fits in my breville smart oven ."
6255,then the air tube had no bubbles but the disc was going great .
6256,easy to install and provides good protection for mobile screen .
6257,"read reviews ,  five stars ,  i guess . when the bone arrived ,  read the small insert about the products of the company ."
6258,had to leave it in my work bathroom for people to use as handlotion .
6259,its nice black leather with a magnet closer that actually works .
6260,i am appalled that this is even considered  safer  .
6261,if i could i would replace the five stars with just two for the lack of durability .
6262,"this doesn t redeem the game ,  but it makes me see that they tried to bring something to the sequel ."
6263,i really didn t think it was worth the money .
6264,this product smells like something out of a biologist s lab .
6265,i had a high success rate with the seeds germinating and having grass come up .
6266,arrived on time and i would recommend to everyone .
6267,i have had a hard time finding these .
6268,i just bought another one for a second apartment that we have .
6269,but works great on potatoes carrots cucumbers and the such .
6270,"but ,  in practice ,  that just means it might take a few more seconds per item ."
6271,i purchased two collars and both worked great for a few months .
6272,it still works as a regular phone charger .
6273,i didn t follow the instructions on the jar which said use a  lid full  of the product .
6274,other designs i had tried were not always clear and people would complain that they could not hear me .
6275,"my family loves popcorn ,  and this nordic ware popper is terrific ."
6276,if you clean them as you go this isn t a problem .
6277,i have switched to nubian s lotions and soaps .
6278,but they never lasted for more than a week .
6279,a green lighted indicator shows that it s being charged .
6280,the rubber  plugs  do a great job of covering both the charging port as well as the num_extend jack .
6281,"i bought this phone here ,  from firemall llc ,  and the product was delivered very good ."
6282,i have not had any problem with sharp edges so i wonder what some people are refering too .
6283,when you get home let them sit for several hours  or overnight  before you charge them .
6284,after that it tastes luke warm and old .
6285,"easy to clean and well worth the price ,  which i thought long and hard about spending money on ."
6286,"these lees are clunky looking and a bit too large ,  though i ordered my usual size ."
6287,"if this kimono showed the actual size ,  it would be an xxl ."
6288,"after he took this medicine ,  he knew immediately it was not sustained release ."
6289,my joints ache now and no change what so ever .
6290,"the motor also spins up to speed ,  so it starts quiet ,  then gradually gets louder ."
6291,"i had considered giving this case a num_num star review ,  but i thought that was a little harsh ."
6292,that got old very fast . controls were extremely difficult to use .
6293,i wouldn t buy it again or recommend it unfortunately  :   .
6294,when moving the handle back and forth it was going across the entire bottom and ending against the side .
6295,so much better than the otterbox cases that their friend s have .
6296,it is so easy to clean as well .
6297,"it s not an extremely quick charge ,  but we haven t had any issues ."
6298,if you like making your own pizzas or cook a frozen one now and then i d highly recommend this .
6299,this might be a good choice if you want the taste of chocolate without a lot of calories .
6300,"i am sending them back . my purchase was from reiss innovations ,  llc ."
6301,my first thought was that the aftertaste was like a weak cough syrup .
6302,i can even put my iphone in the horizontal direction .
6303,"but like i said ,  i think that is the trend these days ."
6304,delivery was fine but the product is junk .
6305,i don t understand why people rate this product low just because of its size .
6306,i was quite excited to try these nuts and equally disappointed upon putting them in my mouth .
6307,"it is a lot cheaper ,  works well and has all kind of attachments included in the purchase price ."
6308,i didn t buy it to wear it out though .
6309,after a week or so the case has loosened up just right .
6310,two other things happened :  the price remained the same and i find it on sale much more frequently now .
6311,"it worked ,  but i was changing filter cartridges a lot ."
6312,i owned wellness clinics for over num_num decades .
6313,nothing negative to really say .  .  . just like other products more in terms of use and versatility and size .
6314,"if there is a area that might be prone to material fatigue ,  it might be this part over time ."
6315,the smell is deceiving because it does not give flavor to any foods i ve tried so i gave up .
6316,i think that they have also hit the sweet spot on placement of the speaker .
6317,"not only that ,  but one was covered in stringy mold originating from the block and very dead ."
6318,the top was beautifully done .  .  . nice melted mozarella cheese and sauce .
6319,"i dont like to use it ,  cause im worried its tainted ."
6320,i see nothing .  .  . no difference and its been over num_num months now .
6321,"i love the look of this stool for a great price !  it is simple ,  classic ,  and very sturdy ."
6322,it doesn t look nearly as good as the picture in person .
6323,this is a good case and does what it needs to do :  protects the phone .
6324,"in fact ,  that s the only reason i deducted one star ."
6325,"i thought these would be great for one of my cats ,  who loves curled up pipe cleaners ."
6326,that just made more things to wash up .
6327,"they play back with great quality ,  but they re pretty boring ."
6328,the serrated portion of the blade keeps rolling over and constantly requires touching up .
6329,did they do it on purpose so people think they have small feet or was it a mistake ?  .
6330,i love having this because now i don t feel as if i need to have chargers everywhere i turn .
6331,"it s also great for filling muffin tins ,  cupcakes and making meatballs ."
6332,"however ,  they are not cheap for what looks like num_num cents wrth of plastic ."
6333,i ve used the press and electric coffee makers .
6334,the design and simplicity of it is what s made it a keeper for me .
6335,the peanut butter was the easiest part to put on .
6336,it is very strong and has good silage .
6337,the shape is gorgeous and i get many compliments whenever i make a cake in it .
6338,"the item works ,  just not what i wanted it for ."
6339,you can use the paste on clean dry or damp hair . my hair came out a light to medium copper .
6340,we love and drink swiss miss products with great frequency .
6341,no more calling husband each time i needed mixer .
6342,for $ foodsaver is really shooting themselves in the foot !  i was going to buy their proprietary jars .
6343,sound quality is excellent and will also depend on carrier reception .
6344,i call both of these i b annoyed .
6345,it stays hot for well over num_num hours !  even past that time it stays quite warm .
6346,is that even good for people to take ?  .
6347,these measuring cups will in all likilhood outlast me !  .
6348,the disk stem is jammed down on the pin and won t come off .
6349,"let it mix for about ten minutes ,  then check the texture ."
6350,"my phone hangs up when the other party disconnects and conveniently ,  so does the headset ."
6351,"i actually didnt use the holster part ,  just the case part that attached to the phone ."
6352,the tops of these spoons are not finished properly .
6353,"it s light ,  easy to store and not super loud ."
6354,just like the boy who just broke up with me tonight  :   .
6355,if you are looking for a slim fit case for you iphone this is the way to go .
6356,"since i initially wrote this review a few years ago ,  these have been improved ."
6357,the chocolate chips don t taste like chocolate chips .
6358,"i paid over $ when it came out ,  plus an extended warranty ."
6359,this item is a good thing to have to protect the screen .
6360,i m using it with a samsung galaxy num_extend
6361,i think i ll mount it on my kid s bike for their fun .
6362,it was a gift and was very well accepted and liked .
6363,if that was what it was advertized for i d give it num_num or num_num stars .
6364,"again no problems so things are good ,  but if you want fabric to support it just note my experience ."
6365,as long as the handset is an actual native union set you will not be disappointed .
6366,even with her mother s help they found it difficult to get it started and operate properly .
6367,but num_num whisks for this price is excellent value .
6368,i turned on the mixer for a check of the motor and it sounds wonderful .
6369,please disregard these reviews as they must be from folks with a stake in this game .
6370,i have had my machine for about num_num weeks now and have used it about num_num times .
6371,"first of all ,  this product is tiny granules that are much darker than the prince of peace product ."
6372,and it is ugly also the rubber started to come off .
6373,one strange thing .  .  . they have way more bass than i am used to .
6374,the puppy will then respond with little hearts and such .
6375,"when i read the amazon description  kidney beans cooked in spices ,  japaleno etc .   there was no mention of flour ."
6376,get it if you don t care too much about aesthetics .
6377,i have a fluval spec num_num and thought i d try this as an option for cleaning my tank .
6378,when a water droplet bounces and its not smoking its ready .
6379,"had i wanted unreal ,  i would have just bought unreal ."
6380,"i purchased this spoon ,  along with the fork  to roast vegetables  and the spoon with holes for frying ."
6381,these were just enough to keep my treo from moving .
6382,"even though i got it from somewhere else ,  the zagg satisfaction guarantee is still good ."
6383,i have a mitsubishi diamond plus num_extend num_extend crt .
6384,"i received this sauceboat ,  about num_num weeks ago ."
6385,"also ,  if you re under num_extend you might be able to see this scale just fine ."
6386,i hope thermos doesn t stop making the glass models .
6387,the color is so stiff it is like leaving the cardboard protector in the shirt .
6388,"if you want soft yellow ,  i think you d want the one called ivory ."
6389,i also applied this to a tiny white head in a different location .
6390,"this is a really cute case ,  but it is kind of difficult to get off once it s on ."
6391,theres also a few effects that sound awful .
6392,"if that is not a predictable ,  dead give away i don t know what is ."
6393,i got the case and it s darker than what i thought it would be .
6394,the battery lasts about num_num hours from what i ve been testing .
6395,"the bags are not all that easy to change ,  and quite pricey ."
6396,if you have any type of curve to your body these pants will not work .
6397,also nice under mixing bowls to keep them stable when mixing batters .
6398,i can t say enough good things about ram mounts .
6399,"american idol could be the worst game of the year ,  just by the looks of it ."
6400,then they became popular and all these companies started raising the prices to cash in on the demand .
6401,somehow it got twisted and the blade lodged into the sides and refused to budge .
6402,if you try it on the other one it will pop right off .
6403,"the problem is inside the unit ,  not our outlet ."
6404,"remove the cooked dough ,  top with crushed garlic ,  sauce ,  mozzarella cheese ,  parmesan cheese ,  and toppings ."
6405,it s a good way to use up these tablets . i no longer take these tablets on their own .
6406,it is exactly what i needed to charge my samsung phone while traveling .
6407,i use these and metal embellishments to make more protective cases .
6408,in fact i regret the weeks i have used it in place of my normal products .
6409,it only gives the competition an idea of what not to do .
6410,"overall a good value ,  and handy for small jobs ,  ."
6411,"needless to say the first time i tried to adjust it ,  it broke ."
6412,"i used the same measurements etc for each attempt and yet every result was different ,  and incorrect ."
6413,it looks like it would hold any regular style cell phone to me as well as a blackberry curve .
6414,black currants are an ingredient and are quite dangerous for dogs .
6415,suggestion :  make the front cover the same material as in the back .
6416,"i keep thinking i ll buy one of the more expensive ,  thicker type of baking pads ."
6417,"how about clothes bags ,  pillow case bags ,  quilters cotton bags ,  or a dozen more ."
6418,"instead of keeping my toothbrush on the side  as shown in the picture  ,  i keep a razor ."
6419,it made me breakout worse then normal; my face also got red and splotchy .
6420,these are ok if only worn for short times .
6421,i washed them off as the package recommends but the smell remains .
6422,bought it for my moms iphone and she loves it .
6423,i now know axactly where my pens are at all times .
6424,i have tasted other cheese powders with ingredient lists .
6425,i baked several times in this pan and the cakes just slide out of the pan without any issue .
6426,"however ,  the negative reviews are much more accurate ."
6427,sure would like a larger skillet to prepare larger meals so i could entertain guest and family .
6428,"the worst thing is having an earpiece that falls off ,  considering the floor can be num_num stories below ."
6429,unfortunately return is not so easy as it is not directly amazon .
6430,then made the decision to get the best kitchenaid hand mixer i could find .
6431,"it s no wonder md didn t catch on ,  even with the introduction of netmd ."
6432,they offer good music quality with a few quirks and marginal call quality .
6433,"well ,  to put it bluntly ,  i think that they re gross ."
6434,"it s also very solid ,  a heavy piece ,  it s not flimsy as i thought it may be ."
6435,this thing would not hold a charge at all .
6436,"i washed it in hot water ,  dried twice with superhot air and it is still way too big ."
6437,thankfully i rented it with a few friends so we all saved our money .
6438,"unfortunately ,  they didn t know the manufacturer had changed the product formula ."
6439,it seems to be very durable and it is still very much in one piece .
6440,i change the cage every week and on that last day it smells really bad .
6441,not unless you live somewhere where it is always dark .
6442,i have it for my iphone num_num and thought i should get it for my iphone num_extend
6443,this is a very nice case for my samsung galaxy num_extend
6444,i refuse gum or anything else that has titanium dioxide in it .
6445,the itorch is a great deal with the current promotion .
6446,the only voice difference comes from what gender your character num_extend
6447,here s the honest review of the expert mouse nonetheless . for $ i m shocked .
6448,"did i mention ,  i can charge my husbands phone at the same time as mine in the car ."
6449,not worth trying to find the hole and fixing it everyday .
6450,"i finally came across the oxo fork ,  the product is hefty ,  and does the job ."
6451,ordered anew one and that didn t go through num_num cans before it broke .
6452,i would have had to pay for the return shipping so i just kept the kit .
6453,this was a perfect fit and has worked without any issues at all .
6454,yet still the product is a great buy for the price .
6455,this case is also nice for those who want to have them for display .
6456,it was a good thing i read the label before eating any of it .
6457,the belt clip fits snugly and the magnetic clasp seems to hold together pretty well .
6458,no problems charging it up and it holds a good charge .
6459,the pockets are really small and only fit socks or sheer panty hose .
6460,"if it s intended to cover under eye circles ,  it needs to be thicker ."
6461,this thing is such a treat to use for soups that i m looking for new recipes .
6462,i saw this and thought i would give it a try and am glad i did .
6463,also the colors are too bright and look street walkerish .
6464,after that it is more drying than anything .
6465,"it s also cheap ,  thin plastic that if dropped would very likely crack or break ."
6466,"with that out of the way ,  this is a great case if you re interested in protection ."
6467,the manufacturer suggests avoiding citrus dishwashing products so i do .
6468,very good quality and has been protecting my a while now .
6469,"but really ,  really disappointed after all of the great reviews ."
6470,this version of battleship is a major disappointment .
6471,i would buy it again or as a gift for others .
6472,one thing i did like was the backgrounds; some of them were just beautifully rendered .
6473,"granted ,  it s only num_num calories ,  most coming from the beet extract sweetener ."
6474,"these breakouts are on my chin and forehead ,  and sometimes my nose ."
6475,"this is a cheap piece of crap ,  plain and simple ."
6476,for years i have had the krups electric version of this type of can opener and wanted a manual .
6477,they never did find the hanging toy inside even with some help .
6478,i spent more for this one in the hopes that it will last a long time .
6479,"now ,  after playing ffxiii i ve had several tears flow ."
6480,the clip isn t the best but it works .
6481,"there are available extenders; however ,  that will solve that problem ."

6816,i am returning both of them and digging out my cheap osterizer and the mini cuisinart .
6817,the suction cups are large and placed well for standard size shower tiles .
6818,you have got to hide these toys when your not around .
6819,"i say :  hey beautiful lady please go back to apple s beautiful store ,  museum or in reel life  movie  ."
6820,i will toss this one as it isn t worth bothering to return it .
6821,but you cannot use the lg headset while it is charging .
6822,it has enough juice to power it up num_num or num_num times on a single charge .
6823,we bought this model to use each morning to grind beans for a num_num cup pot of coffee .
6824,i really like the extending cable that allows you to charge almost anything with a micro usb port .
6825,"this case is great quality ,  fits the phone perfectly and i truly had no complaints ."
6826,see the attached photos comparing the num_num glasses to the ones that arrived today .
6827,"i purchased one ,  it quit working properly within a week ."
6828,we did much better spending more money and getting a  real  digital camera !  .
6829,i read the instruction booklet and the first night made mashed potatoes and a pot roast .
6830,get the speedo endurance instead . i swim over num_num miles a month .
6831,these give you the best of both worlds !  !  !  i can t wait to train hardcore without any wires !  .
6832,i would recommed you just go out and clean the yard asap to remove the temptation .
6833,seem to be a good strong goblet too .
6834,the only thing i would change is the length of the hook .
6835,the machine does shut off automatically when the resevoir is empty .
6836,i have a pretty standard electric range and at first it appeared that the wok ring did not fit .
6837,the gingerbread version of android is a real stunner .
6838,i will never go back to pur for my coffee making .
6839,"this is the first dutch oven ive owned ,  so i cant compare to others ."
6840,the most nerve wrecking however was attempting to use the aforementioned  wonder  items .
6841,i only wish they would offer it in black .
6842,it can be used in the microwave to reheat food .
6843,think of these elph s as nokia s of digicams .
6844,num_num filters are gonna last me a year or more .
6845,"other than that ,  an excellent value that looks quite sharp on the phone ."
6846,"but the real problem is the frame rate ,  which is just horrible at times ."
6847,many a plastic baster has demised in the preparation of this dish .
6848,i recieved this pasta maker attachment for christmas in num_extend
6849,i don t like the newer stand mixers either since they are very noisy compared to my older models .
6850,haven t had mine for num_num months and use it maybe num_extend a week for toast .
6851,i have bought this for several people over time and they still comment on it .
6852,callers at the other end are always complaining of the poor quality .
6853,"if you do it according to their instructions ,  your eggs are raw and clear ."
6854,the case is about half as big as the seido innocell and it fits the innocell battery .
6855,"i like that it has a carafe instead of a burner ,  which inevitably burns coffee ."
6856,you control the machine and the type of grind you want .
6857,"given all the positive reviews ,  i was anxious to try these noodles ."
6858,plus these meals are awesome in the fall .
6859,"the keyboard was not abused ,  nothing was spilled on it ,  and it was not banged on or mistreated ."
6860,customer service suggested loosening to last screw on the left of the receiver but that didn t help .
6861,much too much hassle for a stupid thermometer .
6862,i worry that over time to repeated folding of the band would cause wear on the wires .
6863,within several months the motor no longer worked on it .
6864,this is the only thing they should change !  .
6865,i placed pans on my extra deep burner covers and they became dented and scratched .
6866,the one thing i d like to add to all the great reviews is this .
6867,i purchased a used kitchenaide mixer and it didn t come with the dough hook .
6868,right out of the box one of the fans did not operate .
6869,"i do have two recommendations on this note ,  however ."
6870,"it is bulky ,  it is rubbery ,  it is not sleek nor pretty; but it will protect your phone ."
6871,"i bought this item and what ever could have been wrong with it ,  was wrong with it ."
6872,"i am the most amateur cook you might ever meet ,  but i love love love love fresh garlic ."
6873,only reason i didn t give it num_num stars was it is not made in the u . s . a .
6874,i bought this dog toothbrush at the same time i purchased c . e . t .
6875,maybe it was our fault and you re not suppose to use this at such high temperatures .
6876,this is another high quality item from microplane .
6877,"this does indeed pop gourmet kernels with hot air only ,  and it does get hot ."
6878,i bought this because my lg battery was running out of charge .
6879,"these parabens are readily absorbed through the skin and scalp ,  they are estrogenic ,  and build up in breast tissue ."
6880,fingerprints do not smudge up my screen anymore and glare from indoor lighting is no longer an issue .
6881,i bought this for my husband as he travels a ton and is starting to have back problems .
6882,then i dump it in another bowl because the popping bowls stays hot for a while .
6883,"it cleans easily as well ,  which is the icing on the cake ."
6884,"the medium bag easily fits a tube ,  bike multi tool ,  keys and a cell phone ."
6885,"this is a nice case ,  but the relevancy is not there ."
6886,i gave it to my dog and she had it ripped to pieces in about num_num seconds .
6887,the gold filter allows more oil and particulates into the coffee .
6888,i like the small size as i do not have a large kitchen counter .
6889,it s a decent concept but just didn t work out for us .
6890,i use fans every night to sleep for the white noise and this is great .
6891,i found this to be much less sticky to hold on to than any other skin i bought .
6892,can t complain about something a product is not made to do .
6893,i wouldn t even try to use it with him .
6894,but i m just not finding this game fun .
6895,"again ,  this is not the fault or virtue of the popper ."
6896,"i tried using on a little ,  maybe a dime amount ,  and it still left my hair flaky ."
6897,i could not believe that this popper works so well .
6898,i ve used a blade grinder for enternity and finally after doing research made this purchase .
6899,this makes a decent quantity of popcorn in a short amount of time .
6900,i will add another tea bag or two next time and it should be fine .
6901,i hope that ea will realize the mistake they made and rethink their actions for future releases .
6902,it just turned the crusties in to a deep black paste and smudged it all around .
6903,"i have cooked brownies ,  fish ,  veggies ,  pizza ,  ect ."
6904,"i have previously only experienced sticker shock when shopping for a car or electronics . plus ,  pleasing to the eye ."
6905,"once i put it on ,  i completely forget about it .  .  . until i receive a call ."
6906,i don t know how i ever lived without it .
6907,"they are decent quality ,  though the stitching is poor compared to loafers from before the outsourcing ."
6908,i like the product and it was a great price .
6909,the handle design is pretty good and easy to manipulate the can .
6910,"bad egg i guess ,  but that seems to happen a lot with tamron ,  or so i have read ."
6911,"without lows and mids ,  the volume seems to be % lower than the original product ."
6912,bulgarian style is best for custard style yogurt .  .  . the kind we re used to getting at the market .
6913,you can do more than num_num cup at a time and don t have to worry about spilling over .
6914,"the extra price isn t for better quality ,  just a nicer exterior ."
6915,"we had two pizza cutters that were both over num_num years old ,  that this replaced ."
6916,when i called tivoli today i was informed that for $ they would take a look a it .
6917,the dog didnt like this at all and the smell is atrocious .
6918,and one side is taken up by a window for an id card .
6919,"this is a game you d get more value out of ,  by playing against friends ."
6920,it is the best way to preserve matches and personal cards when you are camping or boating .
6921,the case is nice but i m not a huge fan of the fit .
6922,altho i love the looks of this toy  bright colors  it isn t very engaging .
6923,"like the title says ,  i m not sure these  super pills  are quite worth the price ."
6924,i d rather bake at home than buy anything that tastes like they didn t clean the sheet pans between bakings .
6925,"have never used it , wasn t willing to  wire up  my bike to use it ."
6926,"unfortunately ,  that dosage of num_num capsules per day is very costly ."
6927,easy to snip your finger skin if not careful .
6928,"yes ,  as pointed out by previous reviewer ,  this item has been revised ."
6929,the kinivo also consistently had an easier time connecting to my iphone .
6930,this machine is best for every night use .
6931,"oh well ,  at least i have liquid hand soap for the near future ."
6932,just i recommendation do not use them at they gym .
6933,the store brands would leave many unpopped and half popped kernels that were not good to eat .
6934,i have definitely gotten value for my money with this brand of cookware .
6935,even using a skinnier tire num_extend this pump failed to pump at all even after several minutes of trying .
6936,i use the plastic lids for the ball jars for freezing and storing food in the refrigerator .
6937,ordered a brand i had used before and liked .
6938,we have num_num and use them for every type of cooking .
6939,it is a shame since the product works fine on devices with completely flat screens .
6940,i m a lefty and have no problems using this .
6941,"living alone ,  this one was perfect for me ."
6942,the itrip also required special tone files to be loaded into your itunes playlist to change frequencies .
6943,i d buy a good $ pot and another grinder and do it myself .
6944,i will continue my search for the right color .
6945,"as usual ,  amazon came through with a great product and quick shipping ."
6946,she did however have some difficulty turning the toy in a different direction .
6947,i did end up using it and it made absolutely no difference to my skin whatsoever .
6948,so i finally decided on this older model by honeywell because it got the least complaints and bad ratings .
6949,"solid construction ,  great coating ,  makes beautiful cakes ,  nicely browned ,  and easy to clean up ."
6950,i love being able to bend them to pick up the chopped food to put in a pan .
6951,this bakeware set is great i love the weight and the all around cooking ability .
6952,this one is packaged as a single unit .
6953,my mom just got an iphone num_extend and wanted a decent case .
6954,"its a must have ,  so inexpensive and works perfect ."
6955,"anyway ,  but this one if you like popcorn ."
6956,"they are tinier than pictured ,  about the size of a fingernail ,  but very strong ."
6957,it is way harder to convince a child that something is  cool  once they already think it is not .
6958,"i tried so hard to make them smooth ,  but each time ,  i had chunks of ice in the maragarita ."
6959,she also said that continued use of iron can make your hair fall out !  !  !  who knew ?  ?  .
6960,i washed one section of my hair with it and left it on for num_num minutes .
6961,the norpro fits just right in my lc square grill pan .
6962,"the foot of the sock is fine ,  but the elastic around the leg is way too tight ."
6963,"it cuts clean and thorough the first time ,  and cleans up great ."
6964,the trident cases make the phone too big and bulky .
6965,"once my character became  locked  ,  that is ,  the client would crash whenever i attempted to log into it ."
6966,"no ,  i did not contact the company to get my few dollars back ."
6967,"you d think ,  for $ and num_num pieces that you d end up with a nice sized toy ,  but it s tiny ."
6968,"it s easy to operate and makes a better cup of coffee than any of my older ,  more common coffeemakers ."
6969,"if you re a kindle owner ,  there s a bonus ."
6970,"my conventional straight peeler just wasn t doing the job anymore ,  and it was time for a change ."
6971,"i immediately put it in the dishwasher with mild detergent  no phosphates ,  no water problems  ."
6972,well after waiting num_num hours in line i finally got the system .
6973,these are sturdy and easy to fit in small spice jars .
6974,at least make it free if your going to insist on taking it out of the game disc .
6975,if you really want a traditional shooter for your num_extend try silpheed :  the lost planet instead .
6976,made in the usa . this arrived well packaged in bubble wrap .
6977,if you don t mind noise then it is num_num star all the way .
6978,and don t even get me started about the random stacks of hay bales conveniently forming a maze  ?   .
6979,it would break the something .   they look terrificly cool and feel great in the hand .
6980,the stiffness also results in streaks which only get worse when you try to fix them .
6981,has a little melter container on top also .
6982,but for a normal charger it does work .
6983,"my sister was past the dora game educational speaking ,  even if she still loved the character dora ."
6984,"usually had to be refilling the tank every morning ,  but now only do it less than half the time ."
6985,"i blend infrequently ,  but i want good results ."
6986,brought it for my wife new droid razr m .
6987,i kept getting responses that they were out of stock and should get them soon .
6988,the perk ?  i you signed up for amazon prime .  .  .  . you can get it in num_num days .  .  . no additional shipping charges !  .
6989,"so far after several months of occasional use ,  i am very happy with it ."
6990,but other reviews have gone into that extensively .
6991,all i can get under any circumstance is very low signal strength .
6992,"the directions are good and my application ,  i actually applied it to two phones ,  worked great ."
6993,i ve used the hook and the ear plug .
6994,"so far ,  it has met all of my expectations ."
6995,this is such a charming little sugar bowl .
6996,they really liked the ones they had on their iphone num_extend
6997,i had a good idea of what i needed .
6998,it s just like the one i use at work .
6999,"for me ,  this type of lunch jar ,  is what i am used to growing up ."
7000,"however ,  i used it twice and will never use it again ."
7001,the unit is so light that even my grandma can pick it up with two fingers .
7002,how do you review this obvious utensil ?  it s a splatter screen .
7003,but there have been no complaints and we love lodge cast iron products in our household .
7004,my last weber lasted num_num years and i can t imagine why this one wouldn t do the same .
7005,mine came with a book ; works like a charm !  .
7006,you have to put the whole bag in the tank until it acclimates to it s new surroundings .
7007,i fell in love will silicon products years ago .
7008,change these filters every month and they do a great job .
7009,that s a pretty small concession for the ease of use the dock gives .
7010,"well for one i ordered the wrong size ,  but even at the size they look horrible ."
7011,my hands and fingers were cold and stiff all night .
7012,"the robe looked nice in the online picture ,  but when we received it ,  it looked cheap ."
7013,in my opinion the differences are only in appearance but not in functionality .
7014,i love the calphalon pans that i have purchased from amazon . com .
7015,"the puzzles have a strong odor to them ,  don t trust the paint or glue used on them ."
7016,bed bath and beyond stopped carrying it bacause it is too good and doesn t break .
7017,"the light turning on and off to control the temperature is unusual ,  but doesn t bother me ."
7018,it attaches to the actual blackberry charging device .
7019,"i noticed a full ,  but backgroundish chemical taste  not oder  ."
7020,a gel case cover solves the cheap feel .
7021,not the best protection but looks super cute !  !  got two more for my friends !  .
7022,i bought these cases because they are super awesome . and super aweseom they are .
7023,she likes my num_num year olds leappad because of the pencil .
7024,it fits perfect for the num_extend and my daughter love it to .
7025,heaven help me !  i am so sorry for all the wrong i have ever done .
7026,since they are glass they can break but we have found them to be quite durable .
7027,these head phones and uncomfortable and keep falling off every time i move .
7028,"i wanted to like these shoes ,  i really did ."
7029,and it warps even at medium low heat for num_num minutes .
7030,they now hold num_num spice bottles of various sizes and shapes .
7031,i have used this cake lifter several times to lift often fragile cake layers after cutting them .
7032,then we came inside and i literally got ill .
7033,"and yes ,  it does get hot .  . coffeemakers do keep coffee pots hot ."
7034,i would highly recommend buying one because it s super inexpensive and does the job very well .
7035,have been wanting one of these for awhile and it sure will make things easier .
7036,i applied the buttercreme while my hair was wet .
7037,this led to more than a few dishes where my veggies would overcook .
7038,when i finally did receive the item it had no expiration date .
7039,the cookie racks  set of num_extend arrived in a nice box .
7040,"my shuns are still sharp ! i believe if you re serious about cooking ,  you should own great cookware and excellent knives ."
7041,i am honestly surprised that amazon would allow such an unworthy product to be sold under its banner .
7042,"just got the product ,  and started using it by pressing the single button on the device ."
7043,the blade is heavy and made for cutting and although it did not come razor sharp .
7044,it cleans just as easy and dishwasher safe .
7045,there are no  base rings  or loop handles  which is why there have never been any corelle mugs  .
7046,i bought this as a christmas gift for my wife .
7047,the seal comes apart very easily and is not waterproof at all .
7048,it cleans up with no effort and is dishwasher safe .
7049,"if you have very thick hair , especially coil ,  this can be very damaging ."
7050,"also ,  i experienced huge breakouts in places i don t normally get breakouts and in places that i do ."
7051,this is the perfect size for two or three people .
7052,i bought it from a store and at that time it was around $
7053,the battery itself replaced my old battery perfectly .
7054,i purchased this bra in anticipation of surgery and boy was i disappointed .
7055,what a disappointment for a highly rated toy .
7056,"granted ,  we have hard water ,  but i ve never had a problem with other sunscreen residue lasting that long ."
7057,the levers work poorly  one broke completely within num_num months  .
7058,then i have to reboot . sometimes i have to reboot three or four times before the thing works right .
7059,"well ,  settling for num_extend best  is good enough for me ."
7060,this is a perfect item for anyone who loves popcorn !  .
7061,i have been using the heck out of them .
7062,"it s good ,  but i wish it had two things ."
7063,not worth sending back even if i could as they are not worth getting a replacement .
7064,"despite the fine print on the packaging ,  it is a bitter coffee ,  not smooth and mellow ."
7065,i got these phones for use in commercial airplanes and they are a major disappointment .
7066,"being stainless steel ,  the surface is very smooth and hard ."
7067,it holds in place pretty well and covered the entire back seat of the car .
7068,im actually back here looking for a new case .
7069,"so unless you use a lot of oil ,  using this is a breeze ."
7070,i d still buy them because i can t find anything else that works for this rack .
7071,"it bulges a little but still protects the phone ,  etc . great battery !  !  !  woo hoo !  !  !  ."
7072,i have not been this impressed with a product for quite some time .
7073,"they do eventually get scratched ,  and after a few years stains don t come out very well ."
7074,"the material was hard  ,  stiff  , man made and cheap man made ."
7075,this little cuisinart mini prep is about as handy an item as they make .
7076,there s no need to discuss the hype behind this game or its commercial success .
7077,"one pushes a button to pull out the handle ,  which converts the go vac to handheld mode ."
7078,"i wish i had not bought so many cases ,  as here they sit ."
7079,"until this time !  hard to tear ,  thinner ,  shorter for your hand because of handle ."
7080,that s one of the reasons i chose these .
7081,today i wake up to this product not working along with it destroying my battery .
7082,i can t believe this was made by samsung .  .  . i just does not work .
7083,normally i deal with getting holes in them somewhere and having to replace soon .
7084,excellent product to vacuum seal jars for long term storage .
7085,this is an excellent pan at a great price .
7086,i used this to scrub and soak my husband s undershirts .
7087,had it running for a short time with not much luck .
7088,"shipping was great ,  had no problem with it ."
7089,"have to cut potatoes down to size to use this device; should have purchased a larger ,  more industrial unit ."
7090,after a few weeks of mixing the supplement with his food it didn t seem to help at all .
7091,"not happy with that ,  as i have had no problems with pimples until i started using this cream ."
7092,"now ,  very often i notice cracks after using them in the microwave  and they stay incredibly hot  ."
7093,"i only wish it came with a few extra blades and a holder ,  and this unit would be perfect ."
7094,it is small and black and blended in with everything .
7095,this is the perfect size case for the iphone num_extend
7096,nice addition to the end table in our family room .
7097,trigger didn t work at all out of the box .
7098,i also have the foodsaver tubing and fittings .
7099,in other words it doesn t stay mad that something is in the slot .
7100,yes i did try a number of sips but i can t say that i developed an appreciation for it .
7101,after having bought a kitchenaid stand mixer the wife wanted a food processor .
7102,just got done using the meat grinder part to make ham salad .
7103,this a great addition to y collection of kitchen gadgets .
7104,finding the right setting between num_num and num_num is just too narrow of a range .
7105,"if you have a crappy iphone ,  this is the carrying case you want ."
7106,trying to get on the edge marketing to rectify the situation has turned into customer service hell .
7107,i tried using the shampoo and conditioner at the same time .
7108,i replaced it with one from the local electronics store as it wasn t worth dealing with the return .
7109,gives me options on grind by pulsing button . for flavors only available .  .  . if by press or filter brewers .
7110,"it s just enough force ,  because i wore it off and on all day with no discomfort ."
7111,i can even add or decrease browning while toasting . it also has a defrost option .
7112,"the laundry room sink was next and it looks almost new ,  no scrubing ,  chemicals just the steamer ."
7113,"i do have quite dark under eyes ,  but this did absolutely nothing ."
7114,"when the foundation was wet ,  it seemed fine ."
7115,"i thought this game was going to be just like ssx tricky ,  but i was wrong ."
7116,it takes dark spots off radishes saving the time of using a knife to cut them out .
7117,"i had a set of heavy crystal mikasa wine glasses that were quite handsome ,  but as i said ,  heavy ."
7118,then i started to get them on my gums .
7119,i end up putting it in the top rack of the dishwasher .
7120,i m able to share my personality with the bright color .
7121,i make a huge glass of juice and chug it down .
7122,"plus ,  with the sharp looks it was easy to make the decision ."
7123,"maybe it is just my history ,  but i am still just waiting for it to break ."
7124,the downside is the quality of the item .
7125,"give me a break !  !  !  it looks fun ,  but it isn t close to being worth what you have to pay ."
7126,this item fits men s bikes great but does not work well on a lady s bike at all .
7127,not an acceptable solution for $ plus blades .
7128,"i don t remember the brand ,  but i was hoping these would be just as good ."
7129,"i ve tried to make them work ,  but they don t ."
7130,i was polite on the phone each time .
7131,i guess so cheap because blackberry is not selling well any more .
7132,i m so glad this bowl went on sale and i had gift certificates for it .
7133,"actually ,  there is no size or color sold at that price ."
7134,"however ,  i decided to try it on them one time ."
7135,"in addition to their use in the kitchen ,  they are great for opening those tightly sealed ,  plastic clamshell packages ."
7136,our house definitely prefers sunflower seed butter to this alternative .
7137,"i even attached a picture after ,  i see they did not allow it though after publishing ."
7138,nice sized pot rack fit perfectly over my new sink .
7139,she loves dora so we just had to get this .
7140,i expect to have this spinner working for me the rest of my life .
7141,"i would recommend trying it in your area ,  find out when your local station does a test alert ."
7142,"i use these for cooking ,  eating ,  and especially camping and hiking ."
7143,"the parts that adhere will cook ,  separate and lift away from the pan so you can stir it easier ."
7144,i tried to order a third from food saver but it seems they aren t even offering it anymore .
7145,my family has used this cooker for num_num years .
7146,"its very good for daily use ,  well packaged and a very good value for money ."
7147,it will not charge my samsung galaxy tablet though .

8053,"if you dont have an overwhelming sweet tooth ,  don t purchase these ."

8055,literally the simulated hoods are now an open slit .
8056,you get what you pay for and this is not worth the money .
8057,"the graphics are utterly disappointing ,  and very ,  very static ."
8058,it does all that i expected and more .
8059,i ordered this as a gift for one of my coworkers because her phone is constantly dying .

8065,i like the look and feel of this product and it protects it nicely .
8066,just because it didnt work for me doesn t mean it won t work for you .

8074,now i have started to buy the attachments .
8075,"the lid is metal and plastic ,  fits nicely ,  and the plunger hasn t failed me yet ."
8076,so i immediately purchased both the memo center and the separate pencil cup .
8077,a major dissapointment .  . unlike amazon . com to carry this type of infearior product .

8093,"it might offer some therapeutic benefit ,  but i doubt that i will recommend it again ."

8111,i found this stuff to be too sweet for a curry .
8112,i grew up in a farm family where canning was survival .
8113,i m writing this review to warn you to check the dimensions .
8114,it works perfectly and uses a lot less water than conventional water bath canners .
8115,i would return them but i am so tired of businesses selling junk .
8116,not real useful if items can fall out as you are putting the bag on or taking it off .
8117,the put me in mind of those fried potato sticks in the can as far as taste is concerned .
8118,and the smell was much better than the alternative . but the residue it left was horrible .
8119,"it does require num_num aa batteries ,  but they are included . i need to comment on the packaging ."

8128,i place an open paper towel over the drain of the kitchen sink .
8129,"it says free shipping ,  but it took forever to get it !  the longest of anything i ve ever ordered ."

8146,usually takes at least num_num to num_num attempts to get even a moderate seal .
8147,"the ability to see long distance ,  including the night sky ,  was why i purchased these ."
8148,the fact that a major component of this toy is defective is irresponsible of hasbro .
8149,i have not trouble pressing on the ipod and the touch screen works with the screen protector just fine .
8150,i owned my older kodak camera for about num_num years and that is much better than this one .
8151,"the dogs get really good jaw workouts ,  and i don t end up throwing money in the trash ."
8152,"in short ,  this is one great waffle maker ."

8166,i plan to donate this to goodwill and buy the original instead .
8167,"i know this review is going to fall on deaf ears ,  but i m going to write it anyway ."
8168,looked around and this was by far the best price .
8169,i don t see how anybody can even swallow it let alone rave about how good it is .
8170,please remember this is one person s opinion and ymmv .
8171,"hey everyone ,  i just had to take a moment and share my thoughts on the bookbook ."
8172,"for the price i m pleased with my purchase ,  it does it s job and looks good while doing it ."
8173,when it worked it was great but that only lasted for about num_num months however .
8174,it was not a good remake and i d rather play the original then the remake .
8175,"for instance ,  the vertical orientation of the screen is utterly annoying ."
8176,it s working fine and i rather enjoy having the percolater type maker back again .
8177,hopefully amazon will remove this stain from their num_extend party sellers in the near future .
8178,first crack of the can is its best feature as it does it so easily .
8179,"a wonderful product ,  and my husband loves all the breads that i can make now ."
8180,"since red is my wife s favorite color ,  i decided to roll the dice ."
8181,it arrived unblemished and has remained so after much use .
8182,super annoying sound that just keeps going on and on until you flip the switch to shut it off .
8183,they should consider adding a silicone band around the top to keep them from falling .
8184,i ended up buying the book diner talk and it was much better .
8185,i do believe this is a good food first of all .
8186,"easy to use ,  simple clean up ,  and finger saving ."
8187,"when the power came back on no internet connection ,  computer and printer showed no network connecting at all ."
8188,"on the negative side ,  rice sometimes  caked  in the bottom due to over heating ."
8189,"it s a bottom only tray style case ,  cheaply made and offers no real protection ."
8190,i bought the card and took it on an international trip .
8191,one cat would chew on the string  bad !  not safe .
8192,"both companies make excellent knives and have good reputations ,  and both are located in solingen ,  germany ."
8193,"i didn t bother to clean it afterwards ,  i just threw it in the trash ."
8194,dont waste money this one or the silver one are he best fot htc num_extend
8195,my issues with them are the size and hardness of the soles .
8196,"the rationale is that if there are no elephants in the fridge ,  it must be working ."
8197,within about a month of owning this toy the toy started having problems .
8198,this is a very functional way to stop using a dryer .
8199,these sleeves have two sections and are clear .
8200,i bought a wireless netgear num_extend almost a year ago .
8201,"application was simple enough ,  and they fir perfect ."
8202,"otherwise ,  you might find yourself in need of a riveter . the adjustment part works great ,  i was pleased with that ."
8203,"this product so far as been great ,  don t waste your moneyon a more expensive charger ."
8204,"these ,  as other similar adapters ,  seem to be made to fail in no less than an hour ."
8205,our tap water has a taste to it and these filters remove it .
8206,i can go on and on of its used .
8207,i bought this to remove tartar off my cats teeth .
8208,my phone uses lots of power so i ordered the extended batteries for it and very happy with them .
8209,"i was expecting a lot from this mascara ,  but i m afraid that i was kind of disappointed ."
8210,as i spend the winters rving in the sw deserts should come in handy .
8211,i think it s the combo of lightness and sharpness for which i have to learn to adjust .
8212,there are things you can do to extend the battery life of your phone .
8213,this item did not fit my car as the page said it would .
8214,it s in the pool room and does ok but once you try to turn it up it bottoms out .
8215,i paid almost three times the amount offered here for my set .
8216,"i think this is one game you should rent first before buying ,  because it really is frustrating ."
8217,it has a petroleum base and i think that is not appealing to the dogs .
8218,i let it get a little dry then try to get the bubbles out .
8219,many of their products bear complaints about cloudiness .
8220,"the hard non stick surface works very well ,  and does not pick up butter grease like some other coatings ."
8221,the shaver works but after almost num_num months of trying out many blades i gave up .
8222,i read in a past review that someone had crystals in their water .
8223,these guns are pretty cool looking little toys .
8224,"if using the mesh filter ,  be meticulous about cleaning the filter ."
8225,i often have several things all going at once .
8226,got a different brand elsewhere that works fine .
8227,the paper towel can then be used for another purpose .
8228,buy it if you only have a num_num and you dont get a multi choice .
8229,why buy a cool looking iphone and put on a clunky case ?  this looks and feels great .
8230,this cable is just like any other cable or adapter that comes with the product .
8231,i searched all the reviews on the site .
8232,we especially like to add walnuts to the basic batter .
8233,i have used several brands of compressed air as i work in the i . t .
8234,if i could give num_num stars i would .
8235,"she loved it and i was delightfully surprised at the quality of the box ,  sticks and crane holders ."
8236,and there is no  car mode  with the samsung app .
8237,maybe a dvd of people doing it would help .
8238,"about a month ago it started acting funny ,  would bounce back and forth between charging and not charging ."
8239,i better stick with the tough indestructable rubber ones for this dog .
8240,"nothing wrong with camping ,  but i like the gps when i go into the woods ."
8241,my fingers reek of it and i can even smell it on my face .
8242,"first of i cant really complain about the price !  its practically a steal !  it looks good ,  feels good ."
8243,it does do the job fine but not as easily as i thought which is my fault .
8244,it was only in num_num that i actually played through the original  the legend of zelda  .
8245,i definitely wouldn t recommend this to anyone who has acne .
8246,"this mortar and pestle is a great lil accent to my baking toolbox ,  its weight is just perfect ."
8247,"upon opening the bags ,  there was a very strong odor of rancid oil ."
8248,that same day i bought one for myself .
8249,overall i am very happy with this unit but num_num things i wish this unit has .
8250,go down in all directions but the way they should and hang up in the hopper .
8251,i really like these so well that i ordered more .
8252,i would use this for about num_num minutes once a week .
8253,might cost more but you save $ not having to keep buying cheap junkie screens like this one is .
8254,i put this together in less than num_num minutes !  high quality .
8255,it had a nice variety of exclusive titles and sported a lower price than both other systems .
8256,"the machine will rock and walk under those conditions ,  and even pop the bowl off at times ."
8257,my battery doesn t last all that long but it is worth what i paid for it .
8258,stores had the same bulbs priced in the $ area and amazon had them for $
8259,who designed this thing ?  all it does is get smashed and caught in everything and get in the way .
8260,i bought one for the nexus and another for an evo .
8261,even with the large silicone mat i have .
8262,from a fit and finish point of view .
8263,poison has got to be the most cloying perfume ever created .
8264,"overall it is a breeze to set up ,  and i use it every day ."
8265,"my hair was pretty light ,  and i put this on wanting the wonderful color on the box and swatch ."
8266,it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand .
8267,i do use it constantly to steam vegetables .
8268,can be used as a mouse but i have a mouse that i am already comfortable with .
8269,this is a nice little machine for trimming up most any part of the body .
8270,it s absolutely everything you would expect out of a good quality screen protector .
8271,bleh . but if you can deal with the aforementioned it s a nifty size package .
8272,i use the phone from num_extend to around num_extend and it s usually almost dead when i get home .
8273,i use the shun straightening rod and get is sharpened professionally once a year .
8274,this is the num_extend timex ironman watch i ve purchased since num_extend and it will be my very last .
8275,it is a beautifully made knife which holds an excellent edge and is easily sharpened .
8276,"once opened up via surgery ,  surgeons scrub out the rooms and pack them with antibiotics and pain medications ."
8277,i have used memorex dvd+rw disks before  purchased in a num_num pack  and they were reliable .
8278,i also think this juicer is not meant to be for a person who is always in the hurry .
8279,everyone has the same chains of melee attacks .
8280,a must have if you rely on electronics and may not have a power source !  .
8281,"remember him ?  neither does anybody else .  .  . it is an interesting idea ,  but it doesn t really enhance the games ."
8282,realx have a drink cause your gonna be sitting at this machine for some time  .  . two .
8283,"i was able to pause ,  back track and forward track songs ,  adjust volume ."
8284,feel as tho i just throwed my money away .
8285,this product is lovely and is very good for use in my appliances and others thing to my family .
8286,"so far ,  it does exactly what it s supposed to ."
8287,"not for money ,  our retirement fund ,  or bragging rights ."
8288,"i use them on the stove top ,  for things from the oven and even on my grill ."
8289,"easy clean up ,  you do need a big bowl to catch all the corn !  ."
8290,it is so much better than coffee from a drip machine .
8291,"ea you guys are ,  as i said before but noone listens ,  the worst devoloper out there ."
8292,i was very happy to find this item .
8293,"so ,  why am i giving this horrible product two stars ?  the answer is the customer service ."
8294,ordered for my new shower curtain and rod .
8295,"i noticed that while it does darken your hair ,  it also damaged it too ."
8296,i bought a num_num piece corelle set a couple of years ago .
8297,it gets near daily use for tea and i also use it occasionally for herbs in soups and stews .
8298,i was able to place it on my first attempt itself .
8299,this is really nice and adds a real boost to its already high originality .
8300,"i filled it and gave it to her ,  and she chewed it into pieces in less than an hour ."
8301,i have also used it to make hands free calls and works very well .
8302,i d wash my lingerie in the basic and hang it from the shower rod to dry .
8303,"it crushes ice like nobody s business ,  it mixes ,  purees ,  stirs ,  and of course ,  blends ."
8304,"i sometime get little bits that stick in the pan ,  but the cleanup is easy enough ."
8305,"i understand stuff happens ,  but fix it when it does happen !  the thing just goes haywire ."
8306,i like these and the fact that there is back and front screen .
8307,being a veteran technician this wasn t a concern .
8308,they are not good headphones for those looking for huge bass response .
8309,instead it s one more things for kids to lose the pieces for .
8310,"it was very uneven  did not taste the same in the beginning ,  middle and end  ."
8311,this is a great phone and can be used for so much .
8312,"if you already use stevia and are used to it ,  then this is better ."
8313,the back and flip portion of phone was a different blue from rest of phone .
8314,for such a small mic i think it worked very well .
8315,it did not fit the small fiskars ax it does not fit hatchets very well either .
8316,"yes ,  it s not as good as iphone s but ,  for what i m using it ,  it s just right ."
8317,"like many have said before ,  gerber is usually associated with quality and good design ."
8318,"the younger dog num_extend it all ,  though rather more slowly than usual ."
8319,it charges iphones and ipad fairly fast  comparable to wall num_extend
8320,it s nicely built but disappointing that it broke so quickly .
8321,i needed a good glass bowl that can replace plastic ware for my microwave .
8322,i have been using the real dermablend for years .
8323,the case is very sleek and shiny and i get a lot of compliments on it .
8324,i also do not like the new case .
8325,perhaps it was just a fluke bad part but certainly disappointing .
8326,this has made pasta making num_num times better .
8327,so when i bought my new sig sauer num_num tac ops i ordered a forbus holster .
8328,these bags might work fine but i never used them so i don t really know .
8329,returned this shirt because it was not fit to be worn .
8330,the clamp broke and easily came undone from the strap .
8331,i usually buy halo and wanted to try something different .
8332,"the price is alright ,  but these things never seem to work for us ."
8333,it is rather small but seems to be a good size and it works well .
8334,"if you re not a huge pepper fan ,  i d skip these and grab the regular emerald cashews instead ."
8335,this is by far the best i have ever used .
8336,"with daily use ,  after a few years ,  the bottom plate will crack and will eventually completely break clean ."
8337,"that was stupid and pointless . the battles quickly become repetitive ,  as they are constant ."
8338,this was a christmas gift and elegantly fulfilled the need she had for keeping utensils on her kitchen counter .
8339,i tried to place it back in but it keeps falling out and irritates my ear .
8340,excellent product that steams veggies in very little time .
8341,"white teas are generally expensive ,  and it was suspicious how cheap this was ."
8342,the home button won t work until you snap the glass back down completely .
8343,the phone that comes with it is so quiet though .
8344,one nut for the chute fell off in the first num_num minutes of use .
8345,"in this game ,  the short time span makes it impossible to do anything with the minor powers ."
8346,one of the few remaining made in usa items .
8347,i ve been using it for about two months now and i love it to pieces .
8348,i use it every so often to break ice .
8349,"finally ,  the case was pretty ugly . i think that this technology is going to rock in a decade or so ."
8350,"however ,  i read the reviews on this anker unit and saw pretty good reviews overall ."
8351,"however ,  you can get fiber in many other ways ."
8352,doesn t come with the red flip up release .
8353,we are new to juicing but i must say that we are very happy with this juicer .
8354,i might try to fashion something out of velcro .
8355,"they are flexible enough ,  and are easily hand washable ."
8356,i didn t want to have to deal with the snaps every day when i cleaned out the box .
8357,"you have to unplug it ,  or else it stays on standby ."
8358,i ordered a batch and when walking through safeway got them for $
8359,"we bought this knowing it wouldn t be used for tea ,  but needed a small strainer and this was perfect ."
8360,"now i have to commend the presentation ,  the aesthetics ,  the art ,  the music ,  the visuals on the whole ."
8361,"this is the one i ll continue to buy ,  as they don t test on animals ."
8362,this is attached to an older starplus sts phone .
8363,"so ,  once i get my emulation problems out of the way ,  i was up and running with my game ."
8364,"that s a much better deal . if you re a value shopper ,  you should check out this alternative ."
8365,i had been using a bamboo drying rack .
8366,it is fairly cheap to but and can be washed many times before having to be replaced .
8367,"i didn t try ordering direct from otterbox ,  because i gave up ."
8368,i would and have recommended to my friends .
8369,they should market these gloves for light activity or something .
8370,some of the other chicken flavor ones taste better .
8371,"yes you need to hook up electrodes but ,  it relieves the pain whilst giving a nice massage ."
8372,our vet reccomends having your ferret eat a couple different foods .
8373,"i tried using it on a phone call ,  the mic was not good enough to use it this way ."
8374,it s too bad because the heft and length of the cable seemed to promise a superior product .
8375,"addtionally ,  if any sweat drips down onto one of the ear phones ,  it effectively mutes that side ."
8376,"these smell delicious and aren t greasy ,  but they aren t effective in taking makeup off ."
8377,"works well in protecting one s trash from tricky puppies ,  who just love digging for gold ."
8378,i bought this cable because i purchesed a turtle beach headset .
8379,good product but poor design in my opinion .
8380,the patrol cars that i normally meet keep their radar turned on .
8381,"well ,  i bought the muvo in late num_num for my son . within num_num months ,  problem occurred ."
8382,measurements are the same as other cooking methods .
8383,the lovebirds can be seen on all blue willow designs .  there then .
8384,one reviewer mentioned pulling it off on the side rather than on the ends .
8385,i now have a sierra designs num_num person tent .
8386,there is very little sour cream or onion flavor .
8387,i have now had mine for num_num years and it still looks like new .
8388,excellent steel and holds its edge very well .
8389,this will wear out the plug faster and at my kitchen is not an easy num_extend
8390,ordering them online is a huge waste of time .
8391,"the point of video games is to have fun ,  not to stress you out ."
8392,"when it arrived ,  i was surprised by the packaging ."
8393,they have to know they are selling useless gauges if they can t provide the modified cases .
8394,the toy itself does not do much and in my opinion is poorly designed .
8395,a good reason to play midway arcade treasures num_extend but still not quite good enough .
8396,"too bad because length is excellent ,  but it is not a good quality product ."
8397,simple things like not telling you how to set up a joystick are still absent .
8398,the stroboframe can accommodate different flashes due to the adjustable clamp that slides to hold the flash in place .
8399,for heavy use i definitely recommend the pro .
8400,"pliers don t work ,  gloves don t work ,  a fireplace poker doesn t work ."
8401,my wife has a similar model and convinced me to change to this type of ear piece .
8402,the tweezers are very bulky and don t feel like the plastic is very durable .
8403,after that it felt like something just fell apart inside it .
8404,"the display is great ,  you can surf the web and facebook with ease ."
8405,"my dogs would not even eat them ,  so i gave them to a rescue .  .  . maybe they will ?  ."
8406,have not had a chance to put it into my truck yet .
8407,don t set a presto fry daddy on it unless you want to smell cooking bamboo .
8408,"regular plastic funnels don t have a handle ,  just a flap to hold on to ."
8409,"it is unbelievably noisy ,  and i think that s what they like ,  plus it s very fast paced ."
8410,"some people are looking for a miracle and believe me ,  this is not it ."
8411,these are the correct replacement for my panasonic vacuum and are working perfectly .
8412,"i got these quickly ,  they look fine on the outside ."
8413,i really wanted a canister and for the price and the reviews this seemed like the best deal .
8414,"sounds great ,  clear and enough bass for the size ."
8415,it heated up quickly and stayed hot enough to straighten curls .
8416,seems like the pieces don t fit together as tightly as they perhaps should .
8417,the feet don t have sufficient width to keep an unsteady hand from knocking it down .
8418,the instructions recommend washing the frother by turning it on in a bowl of hot sudsy water .
8419,"since i love burt s bees products ,  i picked this up at the store ."
8420,the material was really nice and he didn t mind it .
8421,out of the num_num that i purchased only one of them lasted longer than num_num days .
8422,"like the carrots ,  or other tough veggies ,  i cut them on the blade area nearer the handle ."
8423,i think it also seems to move and load much slower on the playstation than in the dreamcast .
8424,but their products have begun to really get mediocre .
8425,next step will be to install a higher gain antenna on the roof of the cabin .
8426,"this case provides for a slim ,  protective shell for your iphone num_extend"
8427,swype lets you trace out the letters of a word instead of tapping them .
8428,it lasted a long time so i am hoping this one will too .
8429,if you can t keep it together then you will be cleaning the inside of the microwave .
8430,it seems like there is a short in it somewhere .
8431,"i bought these for my office and like them so much ,  i am buying a set for home ."
8432,"they re also a very thin fabric ,  not high quality ."
8433,i ve dropped my phone a few times and this completely protects it .
8434,pick up the original deus ex if you like games of the genre; let this  sleeper hit  continue sleeping . p . s .
8435,love it still have it on my phone but has a few scratches .
8436,"i was gonna buy this ,  but now i won t ."
8437,"they state the shoes are for walking not for real physical excercise ,  believe them ."
8438,"still locked ,  still in one piece ,  lid still closes ."
8439,i had used a couple before to top off my flash light .
8440,"however ,  when i try to respond in kind ,  i get censored faster than you can say  contemporaneousness  ."
8441,the water tank isn t removable making it more difficult to fill .
8442,it s heftier than the one i have had for about num_num years that finally developed a crack !  .
8443,"it s easy to read the screen ,  it has tons of applications ,  and the most important thing ."
8444,the graphics look amazing but that s the only plus .
8445,"i ve read reviews from people who complain about the lid handle ,  or some such nonsense ."
8446,it sure has some quirks but the goods far outweigh the bads in my opinion .
8447,this is a very small thermometer and came with a nice cover for it .
8448,"nice coverage ,  bright colors and fun pattern ,  light feel ."
8449,"before these head phones ,  i purchased senneheiser pmx num_extend"
8450,this facial trimmer is not what they claim it to be .
8451,"they are contacting the num_extend party seller ,  medical products depot ,  about getting a refund ."
8452,it just has a tiny hint of peanut butter .
8453,"it also is very well made ,  and has a clean ,  sleek design ."
8454,"i recommend ff ix most highly ,  as well as chronocross  very nicely done  ,  the sequel to chronotrigger ."
8455,i think my fellow  nam vets will appreciate this feedback :  do not use the  rain forest  setting .
8456,these eargels did nothing to help make my jawbone headset fit better .
8457,the clicker doesn t work at all because the button would not depress .
8458,"of course since the highest alarm is num_extend than that very specialized situation ,  it s great ."
8459,".  .  .   , the design on the blade is subtle and nice ."
8460,obagi should know not to include these ingredients if they really gave a crap about anyone with acne .
8461,"as far as carpet vacuums go ,  this one is outstanding ."
8462,so he saved up for a new ipod and he bought a white one .
8463,it is so much fun to cook in this pan .
8464,went back to my old linksys and never again lost a connection .
8465,"i also baby my phone ,  and keep it in my pockets always ,  with nothing else in there ."
8466,mix this with % distilled water  and % by volume isopropyl % or higher purity  .
8467,now you can put it in the case and leave it there .
8468,it had no warmer plate and the carafe just did not keep the coffee hot enough .
8469,"i will use it up ,  it may well be very healthy ."
8470,"use a cotton shirt type material ,  something that doesn t leave fibers and you can reuse ."
8471,"in short ,  after four days use i boxed it up and sent it back for an account credit ."
8472,it is a community spirit that fills the entire oxo mission with a zeal unmatched in the industry .
8473,sometime you just need a pan for small task to get the job done .
8474,previously i was using theacase capacitive stylusbut wasn t particularly happy with that .
8475,i ve had a galaxy num_extend galaxy num_extend iphone num_num and iphone num_extend this year .
8476,now i have one for my car and i love having it .
8477,i bought this radio a few years ago .
8478,it s enough reason to keep using them in my brita pitcher .
8479,i even tried running the antenna up a flag pole .
8480,it is at least as loud as my fridge when set to high .
8481,it was also bent and the damage did not occur in transit because it was packaged well .
8482,only problems i ve come across have been the top load of my older ihome .
8483,i really like the amount of any liquid can hold .
8484,they don t feel as substantial as ceramic plates .
8485,save your money and find something similiar local .
8486,it was also really uncomfortable and felt like its was digging into me when i sat down .
8487,"because of the discomfort and overall  clunkiness ,   i m returning these headphones ."
8488,we received the filter promptly after placing the order and the improvement in taste is substantial .
8489,this product has performed flawlessly in my travels .
8490,"the carafe warmer can be set at low ,  medium ,  or high for the temperature that s right for you ."
8491,my grandmother always swore by her cast iron .
8492,he is currently studying culinary arts and likes the blender and the attachments .
8493,in the description it seemed like they just stuck by themselves and were comfortable but absolutely not .
8494,when you package something cheap then it feels cheap .
8495,the heavier parchment style labels seem to split a little less evenly .
8496,"the old one had a slick ,  plastic surface ,  and i had to use a bicycle pump to inflate it ."
8497,the fact that the manufacturer of this bar claims  nothing cooked and nothing processed  is nothing short of fraud .
8498,"these hooks fit it fine ,  but aren t exactly the same as the ones that came with the rack ."
8499,"either way ,  even though it s been almost six years since i bought this game ,  i m still disappointed with it ."
8500,"mine never went bad ,  but i left it plugged in all the time ."
8501,i have tried several different stylus s and this is by far my favorite .
8502,"at first i loved this ,  but it has almost completely fallen apart ."
8503,i still have the rashes on my belly and back after num_num days of treating it .
8504,i also have dandruff during the dry weather and the spray made it a lot worse .
8505,"with the right coffee ,  it beats most coffee shop espressos hands down ."
8506,"i bought this at the lbs ,  which is great because i can take it back ."
8507,i ve used these cutters all of one time and i already love them .
8508,i put them on the barbecue while i am grilling .
8509,they ask me why i m looking at my phone while it s off and i laugh at them .
8510,"so they handed it over to the younger cousins ,  ages num_num num_extend"
8511,"again ,  the num_extend with the num_extend batteries will not work correctly in your droid x or droid num_extend"
8512,was a drop in upgrade and she couldn t be happier .
8513,wth !  ?  !  !  !  even bb and windows mobile num_num and num_num can do it back in num_extend
8514,i will not be buying this toy again .
8515,i think i ll stick with my current stock of shower gels and body washes .
8516,"games that supposedly reinvented doom num_extend formula ,  and made games mass market items ."
8517,what s the use then ? we bought the metal trap and that worked .
8518,"it looks great in the pictures ,  but once upon opening the box ,  i was so disappointed ."
8519,the candy tastes really really sweet even  sugar free  is advertised .
8520,charges it and controls it without any issues .
8521,"the problem is ,  the way the environment is set up it is hard to see where you are going ."
8522,i caught my husband stirring it with a fork and i almost had a heart attack .
8523,i didn t expect much for the price i paid but i was happy with this battery .
8524,the motor is so powerful and smooth that any noise is pleasant .
8525,the razr has to be either on vibrate with no sound or ring .
8526,the battery has a groove at the bottom which makes it impossible to fit in the num_extend battery compartment .
8527,i was looking for something more liquid and instead i got a gel .
8528,"very durable and heavy enough to provide some gravitas to your next meal ,  be it oatmeal or pasta !  ."
8529,this is a great spatula to use on a non stick surface .
8530,i would not spend one cent on this .
8531,only an idiot would give this less than five stars .
8532,great price and works like it was advertised .
8533,"my wife is not a gamer like me ,  but there are a few games that she likes ."
8534,but the mane portion basically ruins this product .
8535,"also ,  the flexible wand is hard to work with ."
8536,it heats up fairly quickly for the price point .
8537,"try to avoid this game alltogether ,  unless you don t mind playing num_num dollars for it ."
8538,i m not sure who these gloves are meant to fit .
8539,there are a few issues with the condor caps .
8540,this is an excellent product . this is easy to clean .
8541,"my phone remained the same ,  it works perfectly ."
8542,"the basket rotates to keep food circulating ,  so it doesn t become one lump of a mess ."
8543,"i ve had one chicago knife for num_num years ,  and it keeps an edge well and sharpens up easily ."
8544,you can easily make latte arts using this .
8545,it scares the crud out of my son .
8546,this unit makes my droid num_num easier to use .
8547,"this will flow through the machine ,  which automatically shuts off when complete ."
8548,i believe the issue has to be on the driver .
8549,so i gave one to a friend with a samsung galaxy something or other .
8550,i paired it with my iphone num_extend and haven t had any problems with it .
8551,"you get a good deal of output from it ,  which is probably its best feature ."
8552,i was looking for a really sheer nice highlighter . i got this and wanted to try it immediately .
8553,"my iphone may look bulky ,  but i have friends who wished they had purchased one for their device ."
8554,"i do not use this for smashing ice ,  only for making pastes and smoothies ."
8555,"the best tasting bar i ve ever had ,  and i ve tried plenty ."
8556,it was bought for a friend of mine and she loves it .
8557,all i can say is don t waste your money on the spyro games for num_extend num_extend or the wii .
8558,kind of a cool idea but not the best product .
8559,with so many usb chargers being included with portable devices this is the ideal splitter for family road trips .
8560,perfect combination for use in a vehicle with limited usb outlets .
8561,audio reception is excellent even for those like me with moderate hearing loss .
8562,i am thrilled with the fact that i no longer have to worry about running out of juice .
8563,"as many other reviews have emphasized ,  they re all natural and not needlessly bleached like other paper filters out there ."
8564,thought that they would have lasted longer than the month i have had them .
8565,important update :  i see now that amazon is listing this at $
8566,sometimes trial and error is where you learn .
8567,i m using a blackberry bold whose keyboard i prefer because the keys are less pointed on the bold .
8568,i turned the screw num_num times to the left and it won t come off .
8569,"also ,  when the bluetooth is properly connected ,  the bluetooth connection indicator will flash blue intermittently before turning off ."
8570,she never playded for more that num_num minutes with this game .
8571,i ve always been upset at how expensive apple s iphone accessories are .
8572,my cats weren t excited about this as a scratching box nor a bed .
8573,it has crappy construction and is very inconsistent .
8574,my only complaint is this :  these are clear acrylic items .
8575,"i really need something for my cough ,  but the num_extend isn t really doing the job ."
8576,"i love this charger ,  easy to connect your ipod or iphone too ."
8577,"the idea sounded good ,  but the machine doesn t ."
8578,the box of stones fits in a num_extend
8579,i personally do not want to replace a bread maker every few years .
8580,"made a very shallow dive with this case to take some pics of moorings ,  max depth num_num feet ."
8581,this dock has saved me from buying at least one extra charger .
8582,"fyi ,  with the stopper you need the mechanical vacuum extractor device ,  too ."
8583,the the stainless keeps everything in tact as well as give the grinder its own style .
8584,it s also not any thinner than a normal one .
8585,"i will say ,  though ,  they were a very happy num_num minutes for him ."
8586,it is important to realize a major factor here .
8587,i did not want to keep buying more knives .
8588,i do not want others to waste their monies on demented pet hospitals from the underworld .
8589,the tuna spread has a very very strong fish taste .
8590,now the water is thick and when i drink it it s just really nasty .
8591,"extremely disappointing for canon ,  i expected the  next generation  and got something worse than our num_num canon camera ."
8592,"so far ,  i haven t had any problems when charging my headphones with this cable ."
8593,i bought this because of the rave reviews i had read on the web .
8594,i have used similar items on the several smartphones but it was very hard to put on .
8595,"when i first put this on ,  i didn t realize it had two layers ."
8596,i looked at every set of bluetootb headphones on amazon .
8597,the item arrived a few days after ordering it .
8598,we used it a few times  roughly half the container  and pitched the rest .
8599,it makes us both happy when we use it !  ; wrinkles fade out like magic when you use it .
8600,i hope this one lasts just as long .
8601,they will last a lifetime from what i can tell .
8602,"however ,  every single kit has been short parts and i am very disappointed in lego and their quality control ."
8603,that it would act as a heat sink making your oven temps more stable . it works .
8604,does what it says and are what is described .
8605,"i tried many others first and all had the same problem ,  sound quality was low ."
8606,so glad i chose these pans instead of another brand .
8607,"they may be pricey ,  but i know people who have these pots for over num_num years !  ."
8608,"it sharpened them all up beautifully ,  though the cheaper knives may not hold their edge very long ."
8609,bought for my husbands car and maybe lasted a month after that it broke .
8610,you can also insure the headset with squaretrade warranties for like $
8611,but i estimate i only got num_num uses out of this making this one very expensive mini food processor .
8612,i was looking for tumblers to replace the use of paper cups in the bathroom .
8613,bad mistake !  !  other than that my husband and i love this machine .
8614,"unless the taste of this differs by can ,  i would recommend to skip this soup ."
8615,i found the hard shell part of the case to be a very uncomfortable fit for my hands .
8616,the trash still gets taken out and life goes on .
8617,i have it and plan to finish it .
8618,"the controls are decent for the most part ,  but some things bother me ."
8619,ok i guess for small office area but not a reliable fan .
8620,i bought based on the picture and now i m disappointed .
8621,"aside from downgrading to windows xp ,  there is no solution in windows num_extend"
8622,i decided to try them for my num_num revolver .
8623,i bought two sets and had my daughter take one home for their use at home .
8624,i just use the lower exposed fan to allow fresh air to circulate .
8625,it s not the phones it s the way the netowrk is now .
8626,i tried with a num_extend as well and again no problems .
8627,i was pleasantly surprised to see that this also works with the samsung galaxy s ii .
8628,other products are better for the same purpose .
8629,i purchase armor for all my devices because of the quality of the product .
8630,"dropped my phone a bunch ,  never a problem ."
8631,i fell in love with it for skincare use .
8632,"i ve owned other brands in smaller sizes ,  those always were tossed . the size works well for every day use ."
8633,john chambers should be ashamed of himself for allowing cisco to release such a shoddy product .
8634,"it takes num_num sniper rounds to kill num_num enemy ,  rediculous ."
8635,"and to add a reason that makes most shapewear suck ,  is the fact that i am stuck with it ."
8636,the magnet part that holds the front flap down broke not too long after using it .
8637,and it s microwave friendly so i use this to warm up milk for my latte every morning .
8638,"i throw it in the dishwasher ,  and occasionally oil it ."
8639,"stays hot ,  cooks evenly ,  and transfer from oven to stovetop and back is very convenient ."
8640,i thought this was very acidic and tart .
8641,i compared it s speed with two other thermometers and it was far behind .
8642,"hopefully ,  this company will correct this problem in the future which will give it the fifth star ."
8643,"wrong :  it actually came off and i will have to glue it back in ,  if it is even possible ."
8644,sounds as good as my book shelf stereo system .
8645,"also ,  i miss the lift up head that is a feature on the artisan ."
8646,i thought that reflexive and black isle could not possibly screw up this great combination .
8647,"i bought num_num of these for my car ,  and only one of them worked ."
8648,i have owned a kitchenaid mixer my entire adult life .
8649,it was easy to install and fit the phone nicely .
8650,other teachers at school have also seen them in my room and bought them !  great product .
8651,i got it to fit in the desk dock station .
8652,"for the money ,  you could not get a better little crockpot ,  and i highly recommend it ."
8653,"never tasted what traffule oil was ,  i know its not for me ."
8654,i used this a handful of times with my samsung num_extend
8655,i contacted motorola who replaced them  with my return shipment  promptly .
8656,this is the first phone of this kind i ve ever owned .
8657,"i really wanted to like these ,  but they didn t actually remove more than a few hairs ."
8658,"unfortunately ,  i purchased mine when it was $ and have never been able to use it ."
8659,"and when he did pull ,  i thought that the ring on the front was supposed to redirect him ."
8660,the only time this works is when your screen is dim .
8661,"i don t have dry skin ,  so any moisteriser is usually fine ."
8662,"i mean ,  i left the waffle in there longer ,  experimented with different sprays ,  altered the mix .  .  . but no ."
8663,still .  .  . the second wierd thing is a small metal loop ring in the back .
8664,you have to clip your uncased phone into the plastic backing attached num_extend the purse .
8665,not worth the hassle of having something not fit or work properly .
8666,i expected it to be flexible but that is not the case .
8667,"it has guarana ,  green tea ,  ginger extract ,  it is to be low in sodium ,  no sugars ,  no aspartame ."
8668,do not trust your electronics or anything else you need to keep dry with this product .
8669,i can only add to the superlatives given to this coffee press .
8670,the part that rests on you neck bounces on your collar bone .
8671,the case offers great protection to my iphone and is very minimal .
8672,it is a nice case with a great look .
8673,i tried it num_num days to give it a chance but it was bad all three days .
8674,"it s safer ,  cleaner ,  and looks great in my kitchen ."
8675,holds a charge well and nice looking too .
8676,and worst of all they come out horribly wrinkled .
8677,i don t know if its logistically possible to resolve this problem .
8678,"however ,  if you flash freeze the fruit first ,  you might get better results ."
8679,"after num_num days it would no longer work for data ,  but continued to work for charging ."
8680,this seems to be a good buy overall .
8681,simple solution you have a great concept but way overpriced .
8682,"the third time i attempted to use it ,  it fell apart ."
8683,my toddler tipped it over several times by climbing in and out of it .
8684,they were all garbage except the noishush clip on .
8685,easy to clean vinyl covering and secure mesh divided elastic pockets inside .
8686,burned about num_num with media error messages galore .
8687,"it has lower quality material in the cups ,  too ."
8688,i calibrated it properly and made sure i was using the proper voltage setting and it did nothing .
8689,i prefer the beauty supply store because there s usually more hot ladies there .
8690,i tried this product for about a month on my samoyed .
8691,"if it is on a sideboard ,  i can t imagine when you d need the swivel ."
8692,the only drawback is the largest bowl in the middle leaks easy .
8693,that one comes with a glass lid and sturdier handles .
8694,definitely not worth purchasing onling !  would be much better off spend an extra $ at the local sports authority .
8695,never has my dog ever had seizure until i gave her this .
8696,"maybe i have misshapen ears ,  but these are terrible ."
8697,one of my few num_num star review products from amazon .
8698,this is something that i used almost daily .
8699,excellent device !  support jelly bean and has an awesome screen resolution .
8700,the sticky part completely removed from the hook .
8701,i keep mine in the closet and wheel it over to the washing machine .
8702,"i ve had this peeler for several months now ,  and can t say a bad thing about it ."
8703,"i sweetened the coffee and added cream to try to tone down the bitterness ,  but that did not work ."
8704,"also ,  i think fruit flavors would probably still taste ok at room temperature but the tea flavor didn t ."
8705,it works great for my daugher s ipod touch .
8706,flip the press over and the black plastic clears the holes .
8707,the only complaint i have is that the rolling pin cover is way too long .
8708,"when i bought my num_extend since i like fps ,  i decided to rent unreal tournament for the num_extend"
8709,so much so that eventually did glue mine in num_extend
8710,"they do look nice though and were initially very comfortable ,  hence the num_num stars ."
8711,"even though they said they fit my model ,  i still checked the measurements ."
8712,it wasn t worth num_extend and it is not worth num_extend either .
8713,use it near an ac to help cool down a room much faster .
8714,my wife s chest is about a num_extend and this coat was just too darn tight .
8715,"extremely disappointed in this poor quality ,  yet expensive ,  coffee maker ."
8716,"the hard plastic case is textured enough to get a grip ,  but not so much as to be annoying ."
8717,if you don t reboot it flushes the unused schedules and you need to start over .
8718,"second thing is the screen resolution ,  it was improved from the old bold by num_extend vs num_extend pixels ."
8719,"most important ,  the plastic housing doesn t feel like it will break ,  when pressure is applied while slicing fries ."
8720,"other than that ,  its really a perfect set ."
8721,coffee french press a few months ago and its handle already came off .
8722,the tiny screws that hold the lid on fell out within a month of purchase . poorly made .
8723,my husband also uses one and has had his the same amount of time .
8724,great for short pickups but a heavier vac is still needed .
8725,"for full function ,  this is ideal for the iphone ,  ipod nano ,  classic and touch ."
8726,just didn t work for me unless i inserted them so far they became painful .
8727,as a docking station user i dont have a lot of usb ports availble .
8728,the plastic circles are on the back side of the screen .
8729,they basically are going to fit like tight earplugs when you finally get them to sound good .
8730,i could not fit a couple of baby aspirins in these but they are pretty .
8731,my girls love dolls and the snow so i thought this would be a hit .
8732,it charges my nexus num_extend galaxy num_extend without any issues and takes up minimal space .
8733,it doesn t hold air for long either sorry not worth the money at all .
8734,this is exactly how this brita is purifying the water .
8735,"once it dries ,  which is fairly quickly ,  the taste seems to no longer affect my dog ."
8736,the first negative aspect is the cheap design of the plunger .
8737,"so for the ir beam to reach the ir port ,  a reflector is used ."
8738,i recommend this knife set to anyone who is looking for a quality knife set for bar or kitchen .
8739,it takes tooo long for the temperature to read .
8740,it s had to figure out what mode it s in from the blinking light .
8741,i have a feeling my dachshund will destroy it in a matter of minutes .
8742,this was on a friday so i just let it be .
8743,i was so surprise by this little thin charger .
8744,"great for berries ,  lettuce ,  anything you want to wash ."
8745,the toaster toasts but not a lot better than the cheapo toaster that we replaced .
8746,i don t know how anyone with a thicker mattress could do it .
8747,this bra fits but does not control bounce for my dds .
8748,the groove along the edges is also a plus for catching any juices .
8749,i micro the milk for num_num seconds and then froth away .
8750,i hated the camera angles and could never get used to it .
8751,they are made of glass so are delicate .
8752,really not what i wanted but there was nothing wrong with them so i didn t return them .
8753,i have learned to hate everything about this phone over the past two years .
8754,"i have this a shot ,  but was not impressed ."
8755,i saw that they were selling it at five below and purchased it for $
8756,get the sym smaller helicopter for indoor use as that was fabulous .
8757,another thing that bothers me is the introduction to the story .
8758,i ve used all of the functions and they worked perfectly .
8759,"if so ,  you may like nascar num_extend total team control ."
8760,there are cheaper alternatives on amazon but i cannot vouch for their effectiveness .
8761,"they are not very thick ,  and they just don t hold up at all ."
8762,the ceramic knife is shaper than this wusthof and it is much lighter .
8763,"these were light weight ,  felt great ,  and when i got stereo ,  they sounded wonderful ."
8764,"it is a white pigment ,  an opacifier and a sunscreen ."
8765,i just recieved my treo num_num four days ago and am happy so far .
8766,"but no ,  it is not steady and cuts out constantly ."
8767,it settled into the fine lines of my skin and did not retain any moisture but became dried out .
8768,"looks like it will fit multiple devices ,  too ."
8769,"sorbothane inc .  ,  please take note of these problems ."
8770,"after frying bacon ,  drain out any fat and place the rack into your sink ."
8771,i love it and will get another one soon .
8772,it looks very cool on his black iphone .
8773,also you need to know how to apply it .
8774,or if you like taking photos and investigating useless scoops and news info .
8775,this usb charger is out of the way  other chargers stick way out  so that s really nice .
8776,"granted ,  not really great for protection ,  but i m too nervous to use the phone with nothing on it ."
8777,it was easily fixed by putting a windscreen on it i stole from my xbox headset .
8778,this num_num oz model makes enough for a large mug for one or two cups .
8779,"before doing this review ,   and i am feeling perfectly fine  ,  i decided to give this thermometer another shot ."
8780,i learned to use more grounds with a medium setting on my grinder . that is all .
8781,"if he actually used it for road coffee ,  i think we d look for or use a better mug ."
8782,i have decided that i prefer the matte finish to reduce glare .
8783,they look great and have gotten many compliments over time .
8784,i have num_num more cans to go through .
8785,they were so tight that the elastic hurt my feet .
8786,"also ,  it did not improve signal between floors ."
8787,"poor guy ! anyway ,  it arrived within a week with free super saving shipping ."
8788,"i never noticed balance on a knife before ,  but the shun feels good in my hand ."
8789,i bought this num_num years ago but should have returned it immediately .
8790,i ll post a picture so this can be seen .
8791,"on the treadmill  ,  they seem to do a good job deflecting moisture ."
8792,"first off ,  the heat is very uneven from the front to the back ."
8793,"unfortunately ,  a week later ,  the first time i wore it ,  it fell off ."
8794,"contrasted to web shopping prices ,  their discounted prices offered no real benefit ."
8795,but there are many other lotions that will do that .
8796,i love that i can see if i am running low on ingredients without opening the container .
8797,i have been using cast iron pans for a long time .
8798,he recharges via his macbook so he doesn t carry any extra cables since it has the usb embedded !  .
8799,it doesn t scratch easily but has to be cleaned often .
8800,"i bought two thinking i would have a great nights sleep ,  but i am still looking for that ."
8801,"the crust was much thicker and very hard ,  but the bread still tasted delicious ."
8802,so far no scratches !  !  would definitely recommend buying .
8803,i bought the smallest version of this kettle a while ago .
8804,after a quick power on the screen is black and white and the resolution reverts itself back to num_extend
8805,i guess you get what you pay for it was enexpensive and so was the material as well .
8806,"after only a few uses ,  these cutting boards are already starting to curl ,  which is infuriating ."
8807,they look nice but if they break this easily looks dont matter .
8808,i need one nd filter so i choose it on amazon .
8809,"but i discovered i could get just as quick a shave with some body lotion ,  and a regular razor ."
8810,"also ,  my hair does not look healthy after using ."
8811,"do your face a favor ,  add few dollars more and buy a better product ."
8812,i tried a rubber like feeling case first .
8813,they do sell a replacement holster but it cost almost the same as a whole new case .
8814,"as it turns out ,  it s a piece of cake ."
8815,this battery is great !  it was shipped immediately and even arrived with almost a full charge .
8816,"it really doesn t take any longer than microwave popcorn  about num_num minutes  ,  and it s so much healthier ."
8817,it s great for searing meat then slow braising .
8818,"the qcell battery has its own issues ,  undersized cells and foam shims are used ."
8819,"what you get is yummy ,  crispy ,  evenly cooked belgium waffles ."
8820,"i usually only order from amazon ,  so i felt like i was taking a chance ."
8821,that thing is taking up valuable centrally located dashboard space .
8822,he had learned this at a technical class samsung uses to teach the techs about the hd num_extend
8823,"maybe it is a fun game ,  but it s not what i was hoping for ."
8824,"i m sold on this bakeware and plan on getting more pans ,  which is the highest recommendation i can give ."
8825,it worked fine on my pc running windows xp home num_extend is no story .
8826,"my daughter was very excited ,  opened the box ."
8827,i found it can handle exactly num_num tablespoons of grounds .
8828,"but honestly ,  so many people stop at level num_num because they can t get past the friggin  stage ."
8829,"a bad combination .  .  . the worst part is the fact that this could have been a great ,  no ,  fantastic game ."
8830,"frankly ,  i d rather go replay colony wars or starfox or elite ."
8831,"if they wouldhave had a no star rating ,  its get that one ."
8832,i like it so much i bought a second one for my wife .
8833,"plus ,  the sound does not continue to emerge after your cat finishes tapping the mouse ."
8834,i would prefer a simple tipping top like my old braun unit .
8835,i chose this rating because the product never came .
8836,i would not recommend this product for energy .
8837,the additional hope of finding a curl cream with a little conditioning is out the window .
8838,this soap is highly fragranced so if you are allergic to fragrance this is definetely not for you .
8839,we buy fruit and some vegetables that are packaged in glass jars .
8840,however the riser seat was not the right solution for me . the riser seat is not comfortable for short people .
8841,they lost interest quickly and moved on to the next toy .
8842,perhaps we just got a bad batch that was oversize .

9398,my skin really broke out after using this .

9400,perhaps this may have been better suited for a more mature dog .
9401,if you didn t have to pay num_num bucks a month for it .
9402,i like this safety feature as we have several small children in our house .
9403,"this game really wore on my nerves; on my last nerve ,  if the truth must be known ."

9435,in fact i just gave it away to goodwill because i was tired fighting with it .

9474,this is a great product but i won t order from this vendor again .
9475,we got these for use in our business .
9476,the conditional is so thick that it does not flow out when you want to use it .

9478,room around the eyes so its not pressing against the eyelids .
9479,cakes and jello both turn out very well in this pan .

9491,i have the num_extend paired with the num_extend iphone . there are three buttons .
9492,i had to finger brush it for a few minutes until it quit shedding .

9495,this door prevents leaks and also completes the seal for storage .
9496,fan works because if you pull up on the rod inside the fan unit it goes on .

9499,this will be my standard canning tool for as long as i make jellies and pickles .
9500,i find the bass strong but a bit muddy on these headphones .
9501,"secondly ,  the pictures are boring and there s very little interactivity at all ."
9502,this does not have a plastic handle and isn t made in china .
9503,i brought this for my lg num_num phone .

9511,"all in all ,  though ,  i m pleased with the purchase and use it a couple of times a week ."
9512,"playing it was like being repeatedly stabbed with pins ,  it drags on and on ."
9513,i ve attempted on so many occasions to play this game and to force myself to like it .
9514,this sounds like a good idea but it is only if the bottle is kept upright .
9515,battery seems solid and all apps that i ve tried are working great .
9516,i ve had these batteries for about a month now .
9517,it s meh . color :  looks like a murky ginger ale when poured into a glass .
9518,i default to this more than to my food processor .

9526,"cannot recommend as a pet toy ,  it s too heavy for small dogs and larger dogs will tear it apart ."
9527,i recommend this to everyone who want to get cheep speakers that really last forever .
9528,john boos boards only come in two thicknesses :  num_extend and num_extend
9529,and the slightly rounded interior of the cups means there are no corners for food to get stuck in .
9530,save yourself the trouble and buy another brand .
9531,"at num_num watts and num_extend hp ,  it powers through the job without a single snag ."
9532,"i might expect hand oils to muss the finish over time ,  but not as yet ."
9533,i emailed amazon to notify them of the damage and requested an undamaged and unopened package .

9908,"before i had only had truvia ,  which had maltodextrin as the main ingredient . sweet .  .  .  .  . is not what i would call this ."
9909,"more than that ,  such products should be easy to use and a bit more intuitive by design ."

9911,the bad side is they tend to bubble up a little more than expected .
9912,no explanation is given as to why zombies suddenly appear .

9946,"the next time ,  it would appear to charge but not hold a charge ."
9947,i also use this slow cooker with the dork temperature controller  available on amazon  for sous vide cooking .
9948,it feels very well built and quite solid .
9949,"don t waste your money on other more expensive brands ,  this is the real deal ."
9950,since i can t get reception in my home and use my land line most of the time .

10038,"so much so ,  ill take another star off for the sheer repedativness of attacks and kills ."
10039,chargers my iphones and ipad several full chargers before having to be recharged itself .
10040,"that said ,  i had collected medals and moved on several stages when the saved file disappeared ."
10041,i don t see the need for these at all .
10042,heats up quickly and the handle is ok without pot holder .
10043,"it was much smaller than i anticipated ,  really sized for a cat or toy breed ."

10048,i don t like pots that have the handles screwed on through the pot .
10049,it looks great on my counter and tost s bread to perfection .
10050,"we wanted more instant gratification :  kill ,  get treasure ,  repeat ."
10051,i suggest using a lent free cloth during the process of putting this protector on .
10052,using for baking a quick break works very nicely without having to heat up an entire over tho .
10053,my spouse and i went ahead and each ate one .
10054,"i bought this product ,  but it didn t arrive ."
10055,"i have the pan with the removable bottom ,  too ."
10056,after a few uses the connection failed and it wouldn t charge any longer .
10057,"sorry ,  but i don t see what all the fuss is ."
10058,it works like it says and would buy again if i need another one .
10059,so that kind of stunk but oh well .
10060,"overall i am glad i have the dyson ,  but it s rather pricy considering the awkwardness of the beast ."
10061,im taking even when i wear a tank top  thick strapped  it is sticking out over my shirt .
10062,bottom line :  you get what you pay for .
10063,i can now dry my clothes and keep my energy bill down .
10064,once it started popping it was very quick to finish .
10065,"it is great quality and ,  with the exception of the enameled line ,  it is made in the u . s . a ."
10066,all num_num from the manual did not have very good texture .
10067,my fix for this was to take some soft rubber around the outside of the circular headset piece .
10068,this lets me power up anything with a usb connection .
10069,"ironically ,  it also has no room for additional discs or blades ."
10070,ignoring that fungus can lead to problems with hearing  hearing loss  and with other systems in the body .

10072,no more wires while i work ! a few minutes after pairing my ipod i paired it up with my phone .
10073,it s not supposed to be opened wider than num_extend which is a very narrow opening .
10074,we purchased num_num of these in late sept num_num to rotate in our small house cleaning service .
10075,as i have smaller hands this makes a better fit than a num_extend or num_extend
10076,it will take my phone from % to % in about the same amount of time .
10077,"heavy duty ,  and it s nice that it has the little pocket in front to hold items if need be ."
10078,it did nothing after many months on it .
10079,hope it stays that way . i use mine on an ipad for practicing kanji .
10080,"i bought num_num and num_num were perfect ,  the num_extend had a couple of bubbles but it was my fault ."

10091,i am dismayed that hanes would produce these horrible underwear . if i could give these zero stars i would .

10093,i backtracked for about num_num mintutes or so and was easily able to find him .
10094,the shower floor was still too slippery to stand up on even the next day .
10095,"god bless you if this works for you ,  we re all different ."
10096,it s an exact wannabe clone of resident evil and silent hill .
10097,"specifically ,  when opening the camera and browsing the photo gallery ."
10098,"sadly ,  the device lets sound through on both outputs ,  reguardless of what is selected ."
10099,"i bought these for my puppy but they were too hard ,  she never chewed on them ."
10100,easy to find  almost every store carrys num_extend
10101,"not much else to say about them ,  but they are plenty long and they keep the clothes protected ."

10110,finally got my seidio num_num mah for my evo .
10111,i m not kidding that casio has messed up on just about every new watch that is coming out .

10113,"i have had no trouble with reception ,  dropped calls etc ."
10114,"i found out it was hard water ,  and began to wonder about the water ."
10115,great product fits my phone perfect love the color very much i am a pink person everything is good .
10116,they work really well and have saved her from having to buy a new phone .
10117,"however ,  i am not going to take a chance on a replacement ."
10118,might as well save your money and take a shot of the real stuff .
10119,the top plug for the headphone jack seems to be off by a millimeter or num_extend
10120,"as it doesn t fit my lid ,  i will be sending it back ."
10121,i ve been contemplating on getting this case for about a week or so .
10122,the stomach is a ugly yellow color and its a knockoff version of the pic . the material is gross .
10123,"the twitch ii was okay ,  but has a thin blade and almost too small for practical use ."
10124,"this charger is pretty good ,  works as advertises and charges my phone without any issues ."
10125,this thin and clear sheet protects your iphone without in any way compromising its use or appearance .
10126,it support voice dialing if your phone does as well .
10127,"for those who say theirs does not leak ,  they lucked out and got a good seal around the rim ."
10128,num_extend you can only play up to num_num players .
10129,it holds just about enough and is easy to empty and clean .
10130,gave the product to a friend and they seemed to like it .
10131,i d love to try carbonated orange juice .  .  . but this is far from that .
10132,i had to apply a heavy amount of nail glue and acrylic just for it to not be flimsy .
10133,that s cause it s mostly eaten in southern part of italy in abruzzo or lazio  aka ferratelle  .
10134,"unfortunately ,  it did not kill my dog s fleas at all ."
10135,"we got a phone call from some kid ,  and mr ."
10136,"i finally got it in the air and hovering ,  or nearly so ,  moving very slowly across the livingroom ."
10137,it really is cute but it dont recommend for a long time use .
10138,you end up moving dirt around on the car with a dirty cloth and dirty water .
10139,i have a very sensitive tummy chihuahua and thought this might help . it did not and just prolonged the upset .
10140,my favorite complaint was  it wont vent if you stack a dish on top of it  .
10141,not the best instance of this kind of thing .
10142,i have a brita pitcher so the filters need to changed .
10143,my oem battery last a lot longer than this crap .
10144,if you work on plastic watches and sub num_num watches .

10148,please disregard the spotlight review that claims these are not real silcione .
10149,docks the phone to the computer using this item as well making another source for charging and file num_extend
10150,i got this toy because i thought my dog would like it and it would be durable .
10151,"it doens t work as well as it once did ,  and i lost a cat because of it ."
10152,i m really good about cleaning the screen keeping things looking good .
10153,it s sturdy stainless steel and sharp enough to cut through my pizzas easily .
10154,the gameboy image looks like a small gameboy image that was stretched out and printed on the plastic case .
10155,i turn it on the next day and num_num minutes into playing it happens again .
10156,i figure i sure wasn t stealing anything since i owned the original in my hands .
10157,"idk ,  these brans probably deserve num_num out of num_extend"
10158,we have had no problems with the knives .
10159,these need to be replaced occasionally  after a year or two  to keep the brush and beater bar rolling .
10160,the old one failed to release one too many bundt cakes .
10161,they went from some num_num professions to num_num num_extend if you take crafting and entertaining out  .
10162,my dog had chewed it and swallowed it in mere seconds .
10163,i bought this to try canning without having to boil everything and use the standard canning procedures .
10164,took forever to find a coffee maker i might be happy with .
10165,i told her that perhaps she put too much of the product on her hair .
10166,at num_num months she can still just barely reach the floor .
10167,i am returning and will find a larger size .
10168,it does peel a lot thicker than i wanted .
10169,"i would have loved it ,  but for the static problem which was intolerable ,  so i returned it ."
10170,so i regret having bought this big bottle instead of a small one to sample .
10171,there is no way a young kid could use this without assistance .
10172,slightly annoying but not enough to make me not recommend the product .
10173,if you want something thin and flimsy for a rag then go ahead and buy them .
10174,"does not bubble ,  spew liquid out top edges and cook fast on high ."
10175,this is the absolutely best turner i have purchased .
10176,my next project with it is to make frozen yogurt .
10177,i would not recommend this product at all .
10178,for the occasional snowstorm in your driveway maybe .
10179,i get num_num for $ at the dollar store .
10180,"also ,  because there is no wire in the hook ,  you cannot bend it to fit your ear properly ."
10181,love my pattern and the lightness of them . they are perfect for my dinner plate .
10182,i guess it was worth the num_num cents i paid .
10183,i ordinarily have between a half bar and num_num bars of signal at my location .
10184,i ve been doing this nearly every time since receiving the spray and no change .
10185,"the boric oxide makes the glass resistant to extreme temperatures ,  and also improves its resistance to chemical corrosion ."
10186,"well ,  i tried the product and i was a little disappointed ."
10187,"i told her about my popper and for christmas this year ,  i got this one for her ."
10188,while i only use it for my iphone i like being able to use it with other people s phones .
10189,"too thin ,  too weak ,  and with absolutely no punch at all ,  even when prepared on the shortest num_extend setting ."
10190,took several tries before the phone was able to turn on .
10191,so i know a thing or two about mouse traps .
10192,"we love chicken wings with corn ,  goulash ,  beef roulades and beans and other long time using dishes ."
10193,but since we all have different needs make it adjustable .
10194,"or ,  you can use ice . this machine proportions it all perfectly ."
10195,i gave the remainder of the boxes to my brother who wont take them because of the taste .
10196,very stylish too except i don t think they make it anymore .
10197,snaps together easily and protects the droid x well .
10198,my carpets are completely dry within a couple of hours .
10199,"and last but not least ,  after a couple minutes ,  it just goes dead on me ,  all the time ."
10200,it worked wonderfully . it is light weight but made very well .
10201,"did not pick up signals as reviews , and the alarm sensor was not very loud ."
10202,my husband eats a low carb diet so he eats lots of boiled eggs and egg salad .
10203,i will try again on my legs one day when i have more time .

10212,"left hand swoops and brushes ,  right hand vacs ."
10213,i purchased these as well as the jim dunlop num_num locks .
10214,"i double filter the water ,  so the internal filter is a moot point ."
10215,best thing about it ?  i ll never have to buy another !  .
10216,this product is amazingly small for the juice provided .
10217,i have wanted a kitchenaide mixer for such a long time but really couldn t justify spending all that money .
10218,"even now ,  when i have a playstation num_extend and no gamecube ,  i still like nintendo more ."
10219,"i pick a size ,  massage the handle ever so gently ."
10220,"thankfully ,  i can seal and freeze the steaks so that i can pull one out a week and enjoy ."
10221,excellent quality and still sharp after two years .
10222,i was quite surprised when they were some of the worst blades that i ve ever used .
10223,it definitely makes me question the authenticity and my loyalty to amazon . com .
10224,it really don t have any concept of running as an bridge ap and not a router .
10225,"i had cleaned it and dried it before using ,  so i knew it was clean ."
10226,i plugged it in with the cables i bought from china through amazon .
10227,"well done ,  oxo ! a solid five stars  i wish i could rate it even higher  ."

10233,"the upside is ,  i can walk several cube aisles away and have crystal clear sound ."
10234,we have a num_num mercedes which has a tape player that is oriented to take the tape width ways .
10235,they just needed to be replaced once per month or less .
10236,came with batteries . cons :  loud beeps every time a button is pressed .
10237,i was attracted to this box of cookies because of the  brand  .
10238,i would buy another . jan num_num updatestill working good !  .
10239,"if that is their goal ,  they have achieved it ."
10240,"in the newer version ,  i believe there are two animals per letter ,  but this one had only one ."
10241,i have not found anything about this case that i don t like yet . shipped on time and in excellent condition .
10242,"seems like a good advanced concept ,  but mostly concerned of the sharp edges ."
10243,i suppose this is hamilton beach cutting back in manufacturing costs .
10244,i ve had this player a couple of months and i have to say i am not all that impressed .
10245,i was not happy with the shipping process .
10246,i use it mostly for trying to strain cooking oil after frying something .
10247,"i have had revere ware pots in the past ,  and always loved them ."
10248,i first bought the zyliss easy slice num_num folding mandoline .
10249,"and believe it or not ,  it s about as fast as microwaved ."
10250,no num_extend error or  no disk  .  .  . just turns off .
10251,i bought this for my wifes num_extend turns out that the num_extend does not support the num_extend protocol .

10253,in his video  rubbed anywhere except the eyes .
10254,"i didn t frost the squirrels ,  but they were easily identifiable  in cookie form  as squirrels ."
10255,"so ,  i read the amazon reviews on this fan and it seemed worth a shot ."
10256,"what a teenage concept ,  i think i ll stick with the classic games ."
10257,its size isn t all that much bigger than some other modern keyboards i have used .
10258,for some reason those notifications can really suck battery life .
10259,"and the longer the misto keeps working ,  the cheaper it is than buying disposable sprays ."
10260,"at this point ,  you spend most of your time paying for the house ,  rather than having fun ."
10261,that sad face is exactly how i feel when using this as a leave in on my num_extend hair .
10262,i am not sure if it is too big or what .
10263,and it leaks every time i pour tea .
10264,"the look is great but is is quite flimsy ,  and then they would not send me a replacement ,  ."
10265,this is great slicer for small blocks only .
10266,this case is fun and i get a lot of compliments on it .
10267,i tried it several times before deciding to return the heater .
10268,"it is solely useful for running and catching ,  not any other action ."
10269,they are a nice weight but not too heavy .
10270,they looked more like a burly nordic guy s boots .
10271,i would def recommend this bucket to anyone who wants a very nice looking and functional ice bucket !  !  .
10272,purchased this screen protector for exactly it s purpose  : pfitthe fit is good .
10273,when i looked at this bike wall mount it was num_num $ or so .

10277,nothing as cheesy like this new one . i received my new one it wrapped in cardboard without any packing .
10278,"beneath a load of pretentious storyline ,  there is an even bigger pile of redundant and frustrating gameplay ."
10279,it works well and completely protects my blades in the kitchen drawer .
10280,the kids had broken the top of my last butter dish .
10281,i have had them for about num_num months and i still havent gotten used to them .

10285,it looks great and doesn t add too much bulk and it s a snug fit .
10286,opengl is now officially dead !  only num_extend could mask its failure .
10287,such a great case got lots of compliments on it .
10288,"i have tried other oils ,  nutiva ,  barlean s ,  artisana s ,  etc and have no problems with those ."
10289,with a half turn to the adjuster the problem was solved .
10290,it wasn t until christmas num_num that i bought a num_extend
10291,"the wiper comes with several adapters ,  and you have to choose the one that s right for your car ."
10292,easily fit into the outer pocket of my pack .
10293,i wish i could have returned it soon as i ve tried it .
10294,i figured it would have had to have some kind of wet solution inside it to wash smudges .
10295,"the num_extend produces coffee that is hot ,  but not very hot and i like it very hot ."
10296,i find that these protectors are very thin; which is a plus .
10297,and the toast turns out absolutely perfect ! it is a machine we are proud to have in our kitchen .
10298,this was a christmas gift for my daughter .
10299,i made my very first no bake cheesecake with this wonderful num_num x num_num kaiser springform pan .
10300,i have to admit i am disappointed with this purchase .
10301,"now ,  there s a sharp ,  jagged piece of plastic sticking out and i ve got to replace the case ."
10302,i have about num_num pieces of pyrex now and i haven t broken a single one of the storage bowls .

10304,it was shocking how bad this toy was .
10305,"willmanbought for wife ,  waaaaaay to small so she gave it to one of her friends ."

10307,"i loved it while it worked ,  but will be sending it back ."
10308,the gift giver thought the tent was  pop up  .
10309,"once the needle settles ,  calibrate it to the num_num degree mark ."
10310,"so ,  i received a slight improvement for the numbness and coolness factors ,  but lost the ocelot s wrist support ."
10311,"after reading the great reviews for this model ,  i decided to purchase it ."
10312,this has got to be one of the most cliched things i ve ever seen .
10313,i really like the classic look of them and they roll easily when pushing the curtains to one side .
10314,i hated this thing !  drills are weak and after one hole it stopped working .
10315,i like these for measuring my trim healthy momma drink ingredients .
10316,the two stars is for the directions being printed in a funny foreign language  spanish  .
10317,i am using it for an audible book which is supposed to start where you left off .
10318,perfect for when you want a slip type case .
10319,the backup supply is great charges devices quickly .
10320,i received this unit as a promotion special when i bought an icarrier .
10321,i really can t say anything again about this cutter .
10322,they tend to nick when i m washing the dishes and accidentally bang them against one another .

10327,unfortunately this tea is nothing like the keemun i love and look forward to every morning .
10328,i bought this for my husband whose over zealousness when wringing out a lime broke the plastic one .
10329,i restarted the two month clock when the new wok arrived and now the verdict is in .
10330,i used it for six months on a daily five mile round trip commute .
10331,"num_extend static ,  or ,  num_extend pulsing static which makes listening pretty aggravating ."
10332,the smell was a cross between petroleum and rotten grapes .
10333,i don t know if it was a shipping mistake or an advertising mistake .
10334,i use a lot of fresh herbs and this made short work of the prep .
10335,"they are too loose ,  around the waste ,  but they have the right length ."
10336,good quality lg cable very similiar to the one my evo num_extend came with .
10337,some foods just cook better with clad in my opinion .
10338,mounting this kit is turning out to be quite a hassle .
10339,"from my experience ,  this is generally true for most of the batteries out there ."
10340,the price is worth it considering you get multiple protectors .
10341,"lol !  after mixing and then putting it in the freezer ,  it came out wonderful ."
10342,"and since using this scale ,  i realized how much i had previously relied on guess work for measurements ."
10343,i guess better late than never  .  .  . it gets num_num stars only because it kneads so well .
10344,"it s definitely worth it ,  i think i paid $ plus $ shipping ."
10345,"org ,  its written by a very smart and educated vet ."
10346,there is not enough chocolate or almond flavor in this cup .
10347,i have no idea what jergen s did to these poor oats but it is not good .
10348,from what i read i was convinced these were what i was looking for .
10349,he works construction and used to go through a bluetooth like every month .
10350,who knows .  .  .  . maybe mine is defective or they are all made like this  imperfect  .
10351,works like a charm with my evo shift .
10352,this is a nice and simple fruits holder .
10353,i order num_num pair and each one is different in quality and fit .
10354,i bought the collector s edition and took it back after a week .
10355,they were both unfriendly and unwilling to facilitate a refund or exchange for another item .
10356,the case is snug and feels very secure .
10357,i have had lots of people complain about background noise and a echo sound .
10358,"the only damage was a little scuff on the corner of the case ,  and that easily rubbed off ."
10359,with the dyson you can feel the suction on the carpet unlike any other vacuum i have ever had .
10360,so in the end i think this is a real fine pair of adapters .
10361,i dropped the phone a couple times on cement floor and the iphone was not damaged .
10362,"flimsy blade ,  doesn t cut well ,  gets stuck in wood ,  bends extremely easy ."

10368,"i used to put my veggies in aluminum rather than boil ,  but that had a tendency todry them out ."
10369,a mixture of solid alcohols prepared from sperm whale oil .
10370,either the manufacturer created defective latest batch or they are very convincing fakes .
10371,i have been buying this filter for over a year .
10372,careless handling gets oil all over the place .
10373,my husband is tall and it s still made way over his knees .
10374,the shape was exactly the same and was not in a cloth bag .
10375,the crayon breaks off in little pieces and gets all over the num_extend
10376,"for my num_extend mixer it fit with room to spare ,  meaning a num_extend would fit it too ."
10377,just press the button on the zomm to answer a call and use it as a speakerphone .
10378,not as cool as i thought it wud look .
10379,slim design fits in top rack of dishwasher .
10380,"kong has a good reputation for the most part ,  but they sure missed it here ."
10381,carry handle seperates when case is picked up after bow is added and staped in place .
10382,using this disk and my cuisinart is so much easier than grating hard parmesan on a microplane grater .
10383,"i would definitely recommend it to everyone ,  it is helpful ."
10384,"without that i don t own the character ,  i m just playing as him ."
10385,"it didn t fit well ,  and didn t seem to offer much in the way of protection ."
10386,"most of the time ,  they don t really work at all ."
10387,not exactly what i expected from the picture .
10388,"the slippers were nice ,  comfy but the heel on one separated from the sole after one week ."
10389,it provided no relief or benefit and was a complete waste of money .
10390,"it does make the phone much more bulky than the sleek vanilla iphone ,  but that s the price of protection ."
10391,after i put the rub on the bird i tie the bird s legs and wings to the bird .
10392,but i shouldn t expected much since they were cheap .
10393,i m now collecting casserole recipes to make in this .
10394,my tap water is horrible and needs a filter .
10395,i don t want to spend a ton of money just to slice bread !  .
10396,"she it never happy with how clean her room is ,  and has no real space to store anything bigger ."
10397,"i gave these to a friend ,  who seemed more than happy with them ."
10398,"since it is so large ,  i have found that it is perfect for make homemade chicken or vegetable broth ."
10399,i have been looking for a bt headset that is suitable for audio or handsfree .
10400,"aside from the lead ,  the use of artificial colors also bugged me ."
10401,did not have any issues with the seller .
10402,"wish they would bring back cream of mushroom ,  tomato and split pea ."
10403,"turns out ,  they should give them away curbside for free ."
10404,"no bubbles for me ,  just nice glassy screen . the case is classic ,  simple ,  smoke grey ."
10405,"if your wireless network is using num_extend encryption ,  this product does not support it ."
10406,i have since purchased another to go on the washer since it worked out well .
10407,it s incredibly durable and handsome and can be used for everything from coffee to wine .
10408,"oh ,  no !   don t buy  em ,  no matter how pretty they are ."
10409,i did a test drop onto carpet from about num_num inches and the case flew across the room .
10410,good for super sized portions in my opinion .
10411,too light to use; you need a stylus that is a bit heavier .
10412,"i ve had it for about a week ,  and my carpet has never looked better ."
10413,would purchase another one if the need arises .
10414,bought this for my num_num year old as kind of a filler christmas gift .
10415,the same quality that maxpedition products are known for is also what makes them suck .
10416,i ve owned one of these for a brief period but only for a day .
10417,or i ask my hairstylist to do it .
10418,"i ve had my presto pressure canner for a few years now ,  and i just absolutely love it ."
10419,"if you are a masochist ,  look no further ."
10420,it is a good value for the reasonable price i paid .
10421,youtube has some great videos of how to easily apply these covers without any bubbles or trouble .
10422,i ended up replacing almost all the spices and covering up the labels with masking tape .
10423,it looked like the back end of a horribly matted dog .
10424,i bought these lee jeans over num_num years ago .
10425,was frightening we had to quick pull over and detach her !  do not buy this its very unsafe !  .
10426,i wish i could return these  i bought a few flavors being dumb  .
10427,"good finish ,  not too greasy ,  absorbs well ,  keeps the top looking and performing very well ."
10428,it tasted cheesy i guess but not in a good way .
10429,i like to cook batches of food couple times a week to accomodate my busy schedule .
10430,we re only a family of three so it meets our needs wonderfully .
10431,"it is the station car of grinders ,  does the job but makes you long for a smoother ride ."
10432,this purifier is just what i needed for my basement room in my apartment .
10433,that saves using a second pot and making a transer .
10434,then you head onto the playing grid . suddenly the game is far less fun .
10435,this product started my love for eforcitys products .
10436,"first of all ,  i own an iphone num_num and this blackberry torch ."
10437,the quality is wonderfull and well thought num_extend
10438,i had a braun grinder and coffee pot pair .
10439,any slight bend or imperfection in the plastic backing cause the reflective portion to bend like a funhouse mirror .
10440,well made and can hold a ton of clothes .
10441,"it got so bad ,  i had to completely reset the device ,  wiping out all my info ."
10442,i ve loaned mine out several times and each time the person has bought one for their own household .
10443,i estimate that the water temp for the krups is probably in that range on the low side .
10444,a couple as gifts and one for myself .
10445,"having now installed a set and put them to use ,  i can offer the following comments and num_extend"
10446,"i had my phone % charged ,  and pulled out the itorch ."
10447,i think it is the metal in the bottom screen just below the fans but i am not sure .
10448,best just to run with the slime thick thorn resistant tubes alone which is a great product .
10449,"they are incredibly dense ,  so if you want to lose weight ,  avoid these ."
10450,it was fine for the first time but broke pretty quick .
10451,"when i told them i would never buy it for them again ,  they actually cheered !  !  ."
10452,"my oven vents are metal ,  but there is no way i ll put that thing on the vent ."
10453,i could hear them perfectly . update after one year  january num_extend just keeps working .
10454,i thought it was not possible to find rubber rings for my num_num year old blender .
10455,well first off it s not a whistle but a num_num note harmonica .

10457,it didn t fit exactly the way i thought it would but it still works .
10458,i ve owned this coffee maker for about a year .

10460,i don t like clutter on my kitchen counters and knives dumped in a drawer can be a little dicey .
10461,"we had ants coming into the house this summer ,  and they got into my sugar dish and the creamer ."
10462,"once you hear the bubbling sound ,  turn off the stove ! clean up is simple ."
10463,this leash is the exact same thing as the flexi freedom leash made for dogs in xs size .
10464,the case it self looks like leather but its not its fake leather .
10465,"i guess i was expecting a bit much ,  maybe a lot much ."
10466,not as good as spartan :  total warrior but better than a typical game .
10467,"pros :  several useful attachments includedcons :  very noisy ,  runs hot ,  average performancei bought this to clean the cars ."
10468,"since we consider this a major flaw in a dispenser ,  at least in ours ,  we down rated it ."
10469,with caviar i experienced no change in hair whatsoever .
10470,very handy for all handles that may get hot .
10471,"also ,  these features were especially helpful for my num_num yr old to use ."
10472,i have two of these units where you can hear the caller but they cant hear you .
10473,he is crazy about the taste of the product .
10474,hope it will fix all the problems and i will fall in love with it again !  .
10475,if you can visit korea or korea town and eat the regular food then i would .
10476,it s simple it s easy and no more microwave package chemicals .
10477,this cell phone case fits perfectly and it bright as the picture .

10481,this keeps your bra hooks from snagging your sweaters in the washing machine .
10482,i bought a dehydrator so that i can make food for backpacking trips .
10483,"if dropped ,  it will protect your phone but will also come apart ."
10484,they don t particularly care about each other in num_extend or num_extend or royal rumbles .
10485,but that doesn t matter now since it died after two weeks !  now it s a useless piece of junk .
10486,"i really enjoy the thinkthin chocolate fudge bars ,  so i thought i would give the brownie crunch a try ."
10487,"unlike previous nascar releases from ea ,  you cannot increase the game s difficulty after your season ends ."
10488,"also ,  i can t quite imagine how to store these bottles ."
10489,"they are water soluble ,  so you get rid of them in your urine ."
10490,was not sure would work with our pump but they have been working well now for over a year .
10491,cat feces can be very toxic to other animals .
10492,i hope this works as well as reported by others .

10494,a nice phone for talk and text and you don t need a data package .
10495,it was riding up and down all day long .
10496,"i purchased this for my num_num year old daughter s blackberry ,  and she loves it ."
10497,does what it s supposed to and better than a regular oven mitt .
10498,rarely has a product offended my taste buds as much as this bar did .
10499,i normally us an african black bar but i have found this one to be too drying .
10500,if all you want this for is music then two thumbs up from me .

10502,"i have been cutting my own parchment paper ,  and will go on and buy the precut liners ."
10503,have only done oranges so far and it really gets all the juice out .
10504,you must purchase property then develop it with your choice of buildings .
10505,i put my ipjone in this case and didnt take it out .
10506,a positive is they stay attached to the arrows very well due to the rubber base .
10507,i bought this case because :  i was tired of carrying the phone in my pocket .
10508,it was a great surprise until we went to use it .
10509,"it s probably great for travel and light coffee drinkers or those who go camping ,  etc ."
10510,the metal bracket used to stand up the phone on it s side has come off .
10511,still with in the ship date and the expiration date .

10515,sadly i never could figure out how to attach it to the cage .
10516,it was more a peel and stick on thing .
10517,it is very flimsy and is just not a good case .
10518,"they have a soft ,  smooth feel to them ."
10519,"but the really cute part is that when your machine breaks ,  and they send you a refurb ."
10520,you can choose to have either a high strength mist or a low strength mist .
10521,this splitter has different sound levels in your ears .
10522,it s very solid and the voice quality is excellent .

10535,the hole is too small to be able to clean yourself and it is very unsteady .
10536,the texture of it was also reminiscent of cat food which made it go down all the worse .
10537,do not buy this product or you will be sorry because you will be throwing your money away .
10538,now i wish i could turn the clock back .
10539,that would not be good as the one we have now lasted along time .

10602,my parents always have the whole family over to their house for christmas and they are coffee drinkers .
10603,i would pass this up and spend a few more dollars on well known name brands that can deliver . katiebabs .
10604,it looks good in my stainless sink and fits well .
10605,would you be surprised ?  i only got num_num years out of a pair of klipsch outdoor speakers .
10606,"first ,  who would make a marble run that does not take  standard sized  marbles ?  ?  ridiculous ."
10607,i let my bowl freeze for at least two days before using it .
10608,it looks like some of the reviews are referencing the num_extend or num_extend versions .
10609,perhaps it languished in a warehouse too long and battery is dying .
10610,i ve had mine a little over a year now and it s the best i ve found .
10611,i m a bit surprised by some of the reviews .
10612,i was never a big fan of just the back cover for my phones .

10622,i don t like the cups lassoed together while i bake .
10623,i couldn t get the little door open to let out the treats .
10624,overall the product is worth the money i paid .
10625,"wow !  suddenly my coffee stopped tasting awful ! in conclusion ,  this grinder should never have been made ."
10626,i purchased a few of these for work and regret it now .
10627,it overheats when plugged in to the point where it is hard to touch it .
10628,it doesn t reach from my outlet to the stove top .
10629,"the balls are slow to come out ,  if they came out at all ."
10630,"so unless it is a very sunny day ,  this toy is useless ."
10631,i use it when i travel to australia .
10632,just like it does on a num_num brownie hawkeye .
10633,"i didn t expect anything else ,  so i am happy !  ."
10634,so i had no qualms ordering this product from amazon .
10635,for $ this case works great for me !  no complaints .

10637,"it works well for that ,  and cleans up in the dishwasher with no damage so far ."

10639,so i changed to use laptop charge the anker and connect the phone to anker .

10641,great servcie and will deal with them again .
10642,"the gold medallions on my appear to made of metal ,  not plastic ,  and they are already in place ."
10643,"if you try it i hope you like it better than we did ,  but don t get your hopes up ."
10644,somehow the resident  an american flag fish  survived and is still living today .
10645,i tried mixing it with baby food and their favorite canned food but they didn t like that either .
10646,item is made of quality materials and makes a tight fit to the phone .
10647,i would deff recommend this item to friends and family .
10648,the lids work perfectly and i have zero complaints about these containers .
10649,"two stars due to low price ,  otherwise one star ."
10650,"for such an expensive perfume ,  i expected more ."

10652,she was a little unsure and she ended up sleeping in bed with us that night .
10653,"it did smell good ,  decent bounce ,  but not tuff enough for our boy ."
10654,as soon as i used it it broke .
10655,at least when barbie goes camping she does it practically .
10656,this camera developed an autofocus problem during warranty and was fixed .
10657,"if you must have oil get yourself a misto ,  that s all you need ."
10658,love these for my recipes that i ve cut out .
10659,"hello , this product is part of the cr gibson line of things for recipe books ."
10660,my bumps got worse after using this kit for a few days only .
10661,now i am not sure what to purchase .
10662,"therefore ,  you should play with this system in a area that you can easily clean up the water spilled ."
10663,i tried one plain out of the package and i tried toasting the other .
10664,linksys is well aware of this and has their secret littlet list of what s supported .
10665,"really poorly designed  although the design does look great ,  i will give them that  ."
10666,the sound was horrible and the loop was like a second long .
10667,don t know were some of the reviewers got their  watery  taste and no  head  opinions .
10668,i decided to give this a try and was unfortunately very disappointed .
10669,"it works great ,  very simple to use and pair with your phone ."
10670,my wife and i use this to makeroland premium jasmine rice from thailand .
10671,"needless to say ,  it has never been moved ."
10672,this one is nice and heavy  a good weight  and will last .
10673,bad decision . i knew there was a problem when i opened the bag and the coffee smelled burnt .
10674,you can do much better for a better price .
10675,but there are way too many parts to assemble .
10676,"if you have one that is just marking territory because of jealousy of another cat ,  forget it ."
10677,"the high setting is fine for facials ,  and possibly the back of the neck ."
10678,so the fact that my first blender lasted over num_num years says a lot about the quality .
10679,"it s lighter than traditional wood breadboxes ,  and i liked the many color choices  i chose black enamel  ."
10680,i even managed to flip pancakes with this beauty last weekend .
10681,so far i ve made two batches of cakes .
10682,if i had that much time to charge the case ill charge my phone .
10683,this was the main reason i ditched it after two days of testing with a newer phone system .
10684,sure wish i could trust it to pop me some unpolluted corn .  .  . more toxic products from china .
10685,rugged and reliable all the way . it also has nice attachments .
10686,"the gel colors this brand are very good ,  with only small amounts desired shade is achieved ."
10687,"the num_extend were inexpensive enough i would not have minded ,  if it worked ."
10688,"i ve had the droid razr for num_num months now and have to say ,  this phone is wonderful ."
10689,"we add some salt on it and it s so yummy ,  my daughter and i eat the whole bowl ."
10690,the things that were wrong with the product are personal preference and not necessarily wrong with the holder itself .
10691,"it certainly has great production values ,  an epic story ,  plenty of conversation and plenty to do ."
10692,"seriously ,  this thing is scary !  stay away !  what a waste of $"
10693,thanks to all the other reviewers who rated this knife so highly !  .
10694,"naturally ,  when i saw the opportunity to test this ,  i figured it would be a good idea ."
10695,can t see how they can stay in business like this !  .
10696,that one wasn t bad but this is a big step up .
10697,i ve had it for two weeks and it is solid and does exactly what i need .
10698,"it still sucked ,  but it got the job done ."
10699,"i ve obviously cleaned it here and there ,  but everything is still in  like new  condition ."

10704,didn t even use it for more than a minute .
10705,i bake pizza on this stone once a week .
10706,great right out of the jar .   we should have a contest to find the best new use .
10707,perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is  bad  .
10708,love to cook and once in a while it is nice to make home made fry s .
10709,"i bought several because they were so cheap and i m regretting it ,  their going in the trash !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ."
10710,no side squirt  !  perfect !  i have thrown away num_num presses that should have worked .
10711,the containers are reliably airtight and have preserved food well for extended periods in the freezer .
10712,"although my experience with bluetooth is very limited ,  i am impressed with this one ."
10713,will try to figure out how else to use to display something non perishable .
10714,my last cable wasn t charging and i didn t want to by a whole new charger .
10715,"if that is how it is supposed to sound ,  it s terrible ."
10716,voice guided prompts make bluetooth setup a breeze .
10717,the dual fan helps cool the room where we do not have an air conditioner over the summer .
10718,it was a perfect fit for a tiny sheet pan i got in a restaurant supply store .
10719,at least that was my habit until i bought a couple of these incredible matfer exopat baking sheets .
10720,i currently have switched from the amzer silicone case to this one .
10721,"i mean ,  no secret characters ,  and you change your abilities by changing clothes ."
10722,"on the plus side ,  they do blend with blonde hair color ."
10723,"my husband was able to tolerate the taste ,  he felt a decent amount of energy ."
10724,i checked the google search and this problem runs through most of their product line .
10725,it caused the pills and tablets to swell up and crumble .
10726,best num_num bucks i ve spent for any kitchen utensil or gadget .
10727,these things are huge !  but work great on the back of my bathroom doors .
10728,then toss all of your ingredients in starting with the dry ingredients first .
10729,"with the multiple connection options ,  i can move it from one car to another with ease ."
10730,i bought this after watching my cooking shows and had never used a pressure cooker before .
10731,the bottom of this tends to block the microusb slot on my galaxy num_extend
10732,"great item for the summer corn season ,  and so easy to use ."
10733,you have to tug at it to get it out and will spill water all over cage .
10734,this was an exact replacement for num_num i lost .
10735,i use this mainly for sharpening my knives that i use for work .
10736,i would very much enjoy my money back so that i may purchase another high quality case .
10737,the ability to store the dry lettuce in the spinner is a plus .
10738,the top buttons are so soft that i cannot rest my hand without clicking one or both by accident .
10739,with other camera phones i think  what s the point ?   and don t bother .
10740,i have had it out in the dead of winter and during blistering wind storms and it has lasted .
10741,"so after reading countless reviews ,  i decided to purchases this coffee maker ."
10742,"shooting gamo hornet with lead pellets ,  probably num_extend fps ripped the back of the trap out ."
10743,"the one downside is the preprogrammed taste settings of rare ,  m ."
10744,"as the name suggest ,  the defender is in actual term a defender ."
10745,"that was four hours ago ,  two hair washes ,  and my scalp is still burning ."
10746,the security clasps are not even long enough to secure to her harness .
10747,at this point i decided i d spent more time and effort than this $  system  was worth .
10748,the henckels works much better for less items and easier to access your knives .
10749,don t do it often or it will break .
10750,can t use on tub surround only original tiles .
10751,this was a great purchase and without hesitation i m purchasing the larger version .
10752,some things like burnt on like sweat terraiki sauce require a copper or steel coil wire scrubby .
10753,i was super happy i received a new battery because my previous battery life wasn t cutting it for me .
10754,it is good quality and easy to hold .
10755,others with curly hair  mine is also long  know how important a conditioner is for maintaining their hair .
10756,i ve had these sandals for about a year .
10757,i didn t like they way they made me feel sometimes .
10758,this not mandatory if you are in a hurry .
10759,i bought one for myself and one for the teacher s aid in my classroom .
10760,this mixing bowl is all it s advertised to be .
10761,"with num_extend positive reviews ,  doubt you need another . easy to assemble ."
10762,it is the same label as sold elsewhere .
10763,i got this one that is the same model and it works just as well as the old one .
10764,i find myself using different base coats because this one just doesn t work well for me .
10765,"also ,  it dries the heck out of pork chops ."
10766,"so buy it at your own discretion but once this is gone ,  i m going back to my old company ."
10767,because of the location of the switches they do not need reversing .
10768,this device lets you do that and use your mouse or keyboard with your android phone via usb .
10769,anywhere else this battery costs at minimum num_num times more .
10770,the bacon side works well for  wait for it  bacon .  .  . but it is difficult to clean .
10771,always wanted one and i used it for the first time for thanksgiving .
10772,all the other laudatory reviews have said it well; i am just adding another acclamation .
10773,support from hoover ?  not worth even the time it took to write this review .
10774,so i quickly swapped out batteries and was up and running again .
10775,it also shuts down if you leave and it senses the phone is gone for ten minutes .
10776,"but in reality ,  these seat covers are in the same category as the ones in those stores ."
10777,"easy to use ,  flexible and accurate ,  not complicated ,  does not need to be ."
10778,all he did then was try to bury them .
10779,there is not much to say about the brita filter as it needs to be replaced every two months .
10780,i left it on the counter and accidentally picked it up later when i needed a pen .
10781,i bought this for my mom who loves purple and she used it and loved it .
10782,some are brighter; others are on the flat side .
10783,i like this .  .  . so excited to start my cake decorating for a hobby .  .  . delivered as what the description say .
10784,"the other items were ok ,  but kind of useless ,  since i have small screwdrivers and tweezers ."
10785,i bought this as a replacement but it didn t fit my iphone num_extend at all .
10786,this shoe is so cute .  .  .  . but it runs long and narrow .
10787,i tried the bbq flavor and they are delicious .
10788,i ll be throwing it away and searching for something new .
10789,i have all pine floors with a few area rugs .
10790,to my disappointment the sound has a lot of noise to it .
10791,"first up ,  coming out of the box the base unit has a surprising heft ."
10792,it barely fits a bike without any accessories .
10793,"also ,  the ball bounces out of this every time without going to the ball return piston ."
10794,what were they thinking when they designed these playskool alphabet cards ?  the illustrations really stink .
10795,"diablo num_num which is num_num gig ,  num_num times the amount !  ,  took num_num minutes to install ."
10796,"it is powerful on both hard surfaces  wood ,  concrete ,  tile ,  vinyl  ,  and soft surfaces  carpet and rugs  ."
10797,a real good game is def jam fight for ny now thats a real good game .
10798,"secondly ,  the flavor doesn t really capture the taste of buffalo wings or bleu cheese ."
10799,"it has a horrible design ,  is made of cheap plastic ,  and to make matters worse ,  it s also highly priced ."
10800,"i have ms ,  so being able to put furniture together by myself is a very big deal ."
10801,"i like the ability to run the amplifier from three different power sources :  ac ,  usb ,  and vehicle cigarette lighter ."
10802,even if it doesn t have nba legends to play as  .
10803,"i sort of hate the clock thing ,  you always gotta rush ."
10804,"i was so happy with the product ,  but by the end of summer i was so mad ."
10805,buggy software !  blahh !  i am not anti microsoft by the way .
10806,the seller was prompt and arrived in new packaging .
10807,i m not gonna risk my phone having no cover on it for num_num weeks .
10808,i needed cable and phone modem and it did not have phone hook ups so i returned it .
10809,these shoes were returned because they fit too tight even though i ordered the wide width in my size .
10810,i will be buying it from the manufacturer .
10811,"cable was too snug ,  and too cheap . these cables are absolutely worthless ."
10812,i ve owned this for num_extend years and use it almost daily .
10813,"also ,  a typical pair of headphones with a stereo plug will not fit the radio s earphone jack ."
10814,the car dock let s you take the droid x to the next level and beyond .
10815,i wanted another for my spouse but couldn t find one locally .
10816,this very affordable spatula is light weight and shaped right for most any stove top cooking use .

10818,god forbid you forget to put the screw down lid on at num_num in the morning .
10819,why can t i find stevia without something added to it ?  ?  especially when it s so expensive .
10820,"i put a thick towel under the ecru cover ,  as the cover is paper thin ."
10821,i use it on my htc incredible and now my htc thunderbolt .
10822,i ve been using this case for months already and i really like it .
10823,"i fully charged it ,  and the mpow just stopped working ."
10824,looks great online but when it arrives things don t look as good .
10825,too small and flimsy; is there a larger and more sturdier tray out there ?  ?  ?  .
10826,i got mine last year when it was around num_num bucks .
10827,she s been through several of them; i ve gone back to hoover .
10828,"for calls ,  the receivers had no idea in our conversation that i was wearing a headset ,  even outdoors ."
10829,i don t think any of these products really works well and i have tried several different brands .
10830,usually i fill it to the point where the coffee holder just hits the water .
10831,"in  all apps  screen ,  the list is sorted by name ."
10832,"soon ,  you realize that the developers were rushed to complete a game for konami ."
10833,"the bigger the better ,  and soft for falls . carpets verse hardwood or title floors ."
10834,these usb devices are  trickle  chargers and do not work very well in my humble opinion .
10835,two small test tubes in different colors with the same lubricant .
10836,it works best if you apply a little num_extend to the sliding rails .
10837,it feels like i m always filling the pitcher .
10838,it does not look nearly as nice as in the photograph .
10839,works on every device i own apple and samsung .
